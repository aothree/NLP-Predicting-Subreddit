&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to take chess a little more seriously, currently around 1500 on [chess.com](https://chess.com) and looking for a better way to analyze my own games in depth rather than just click through the game and take notes on my mistakes and why my ideas were strategically or tactically wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of a (hopefully free) website or database in which you can make an account and annotate your games? Thanks in advance, I am a little bit new to this and still trying to figure out the best way to analyze my own games but pen and paper is not working for me.",0,46,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

12,12,Mainlines vs Variations Questions,"So I'm studying some openings and looking at the Notation &gt; Opening Book &gt; Reference tab which shows a tally of the moves played in that position. For example D4 C5 D5 D6 then for move 3. It shows the following in Chessbase

* 3. c4 - 2323 games -score 57% - 2/10 hot
* 3. e4 1450 gmaes - score 62% - 4/10 hot  


Here are my thoughts:   
Is c4 the more popular line the main line? Even though e4 scores better? Is e4 a variation or just a lesser main line? Which one should white play? I'm guessing I should play e4 if I can understand the idea and follow it with other good/accurate moves, because it scores better? For black it seems there is value in playing less popular moves to try and take white out of book, and so white must be well prepared for common black responses but also look at positions for less common black responses and have a general idea of what to do if that position arises?

18,18,What ELO would you say is the BARE MINIMUM to become a chess coach? Looking for advice!,"Hey guys! My girlfriend has been looking for a place to start an academy for kids and teens. She wants to focus on helping them with homework, learning techniques, important exams etc. The usual stuff. But she also wants to have some after school classes where they can learn basic robotics, coding and, of course, some chess.

Now, I have my own job and I do my own thing. I want to support and help her as much as I can, but i have not much knowledge in any of those fields. She asked me to be the ""chess teacher"" for a basic introduction lvl class, mostly for small children, not even teens.

The problem is that I’m a chump. I have never crossed the 1300 ELO barrier, I have no understanding of openings whatsoever, I don’t know most of the “chess slur”or terminology in English, not to mention in my mother language (which I would be teaching in). She wants me to start in September.

My question is: What ELO would you consider is the bare minimum to start teaching children the basics of the game? Would I be able to reach that ELO by the time September comes? Should I not worry about ELO but instead focus on the fundamentals about openings and overall knowledge so even if I suck, I can give good advice to my students?

I’m worried the kids will already know more than me in some areas, or that I will teach them wrong tactics. Maybe even worse, I will play with the kids and one of them will beat me fair and square!

I keep watching Daniel Naroditskyand Gotham Chess for the free teaching lessons, or Agadmator to analyze very cool old games, but I can’t put myself in their shoes, I don’t have even 1% of those guys understanding of the game.

TL,DR: Girlfriend wants me to be a chess teacher for little kids in her new academy. I’m at 1200 ELO and I’m worried that I’m not up to the task. Should I spent the next 6 months learning chess principles like a mad man or tell her to find someone else?",0,87,17,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I'd like to get some feedback from the community, so is there a particular opening variation or two you all would like me to make?

I play 1.e4 openings, so any of those or any responses to other openings as black are welcome candidates for now. Particular variations only, please, such as the English Attack within the Najdorf Sicilian. I create the studies under my Coldfield1994 Lichess account, and have already made roughly 10 opening studies of various completion (which I don't mind continuing to complete upon request) as well as some unanalyzed opening tree studies, so type in ""owner:Coldfield1994"" in Lichess' study search to find them if you want to see the quality of the studies I've already made. Each study usually covers about 8 moves deep of a variation and assumes the player's side will always make one of the top candidate responses. These aren't interactive studies, and are meant to be studied rather than be practice material. Please be nice to my older, un-updated and therefore worse studies. I'll fix them eventually or upon request.

As far as the quality of the studies goes, I usually run Stockfish 14.1 to a depth of 40 to 50 for each move, higher as needed to establish solidly good candidate moves, and then analyze how Stockfish intends to use the move by doing various continuations and analyzing those positions. Additionally I use Lichess' move database to analyze common moves to the same extent. While this works great for main lines and taking advantage of mistakes, it doesn't do quite as well at identifying uncommon gambit lines. Though once I know of them and understand their goal, I can analyze them fine. It's also not great at identifying general, overarching strategic plans beyond what I can find online about the position, though I think I do a decent job of this. Just not to the level of an IM or GM (yet, hopefully).

In return, I'd love for you all to look at my studies and comment your thoughts, identifying any logical mistakes, identifying possible gambit lines, identifying likely thought processes for a move, or even if it was too easy or difficult to use. I plan to leave these up for at least a year as I make them, but I do reserve the right to take them down or sell access in the future if they become very popular. Though this is unlikely.

‘’It is always hard when fraternal peoples fight and people die. I am against wars and any violence. But “no war” is now written by people who for 8 years cynically did not notice the war against the Russians in the Donbass, the massacres in Kyiv, Mariupol and other cities. Attacks in Donetsk. The bombing of the LDNR (including aviation!) Accompanied by the huge destruction of social facilities and the mass death of civilians. Murders of journalists. Burning civilians in Odessa. The cynicism is that 8 years have passed, and they don’t even try to look for the guilty! They were silent when in Ukraine veterans were not pressured to peacefully go to the Victory Parade, Soviet monuments were destroyed, Soviet symbols were banned, people were beaten for wearing the St. George ribbon. How they literally built a fascist state, glorifying Bandera, who fought on the side of Hitler, and in which nationalists wear a swastika without hesitation. It’s even inconvenient to write about such “little things” as undermining the power transmission line that distributes electricity to Crimea, cutting off Crimea from water. And many, many more.

All these crimes are on the conscience of the Kiev authorities, or have occurred with their tacit consent. Just listing their atrocities is ""worthy"" of a separate book. Unfortunately, the authorities in Ukraine after the armed coup of 2013-14 are one worse than the other. I share the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian people. I have many friends from Ukraine and I wish that as few civilians as possible suffer. But at the same time, the perpetrators of numerous crimes must be punished. We all want peace, however, who said that kindness should not be with fists? The Ukrainian state had the opportunity to peacefully resolve the conflict almost to the end. But alas, they had other tasks. Having enlisted the support of the collective West, the authorities (not ordinary people) wanted only war. In this regard, Donbass and the entire LDNR were forced to endure bombing and a protracted war for 8 (!) Years. What can I say, with such a military approach, Russia could not but intervene and protect the civilians of the LDNR, who are only to blame for simply wanting peace ..’’

And I know there's a lot of tutorials out there about optimising my openings and game endings and stuff, but the fact of the matter is that at my rating no one plays theory... I don't even play that much theory.  So to try and set up a good opening is basically impossible since people are just throwing down whatever.  

So I'm going to try and take it slowly, one step at a time, and my personal goal for now is just to hit 4 digits in my score.  1000 would be awesome, I don't think I could ever get further than 1200 as at that point it seems to be a bit more serious in terms of gameplay, I still want to have fun with the game.

I'm too focused on looking for my own tactics, and I'm not paying too much attention to my opponent's intentions. I've been blundering pretty badly, even obvious one move check mates.

I'm probably not the only one with this problem. I think that adding the anti blunder theme to the mix could help not to fall in this bad habit and help you in developing your defense awareness.",0,31,5,-0.3182,0.365,0.635,0.0

121,21,Should white maybe just allow the Marshall Attack?,"I've done quite a lot of digging into Ruy Lopez theory as white and in an effort to avoid the Marshall I've gone with various choices, 8. h3, d3, a4, etc. However what I don't really like about h3 is that black can often try to sac a pawn anyway; d3 seems too slow, as if black can get a very pleasant position; and a4 seems to lead nowhere in terms of a white advantage after ...b4!. If white tries to keep playing thematically in Spanish style, eventually a trade of LSBs will ensue and I would feel quite depressed trying to play for anything with white here.

On the other hand, allowing the Marshall actually seems not too unreasonable after taking a look at it. If I just play with d4 and Be3 and get my queenside untangled, I'm not really feeling like I'm about to get checkmated -- maybe my position is a little awkward, but I feel like there's definitely hope I can untangle and maybe my extra pawn will tell. A big improvement over some of the other lines where the pawn getting sacked means I have some kind of hideous pawn structure or black has ridiculously active pieces on a wide-open board or something like that.

Is it actually a good idea to allow the Marshall then?",0,50,8,-0.296,0.282,0.545,0.173

Here are the results from the relevant queries on my database constructed from the downloads available from the [FIDE rating download website](https://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml) for female players with blitz ratings of 2400 and over (chosen as the nearest round number to give close to 100 players). Since you also ask for countries I've included distinct player/country combinations.

The ""Period"" is the first FIDE rating list in which the player achieved the rating. If the player didn't play rated blitz for a year after that then they obviously retain the rating for the next year so the ""Period"" is the year and month in which FIDE first recorded that rating for them.

I've seen people call for him to be effectively canceled -- to basically ruin his chess career over this.

I admit I initially jumped on this bandwagon for a while before I stepped back and reconsidered.

He is a top chess player, earned his Candidates spot, and his unsavory political views don't mean he shouldn't have a chance to keep contributing to the mostly apolitical (at least in theory) world of chess.

I get that we truly believe we are right and he is dead wrong on this issue and is even being rather offensive. But I don't want to cancel him, disinvite him from tournaments, boot him from the Candidates, or anything. Maybe top players can signal their disapproval with means like refusing handshakes, just like Kramnik and Topalov, or most Soviet players did to Korchnoi after he defected.

196,96,What is everyone's favorite openings? 985 rated player who knows 3 good ones looking to add more to my repertoire,"So i am a (kind of?) new player, i started playing a year ago, took a break and started playing again. My elo bounces between 970 and 1015  but of course that's slowly getting higher. So the first opening i tried playing when first getting into chess theory was the italian game but of course, playing that agressive of an opening when your a noob was a terrible idea and i lost alot of elo before resorting to more defensive openings.

So i researched alot of more defensive openings and The next 2 openings i researched in depth were the catalan, essentially you play king's indian (sometimes with knight h6 variation) on the king's side and queen's gambit for control over the center on the queen's side. This gave me tons of wins, and also allowed me to flip alot of games when i played as black (I actually had a higher win ratio with black then white when i only knew this opening 😂😂😂) and scandanavian If they are white and go king's pawn e4.

I like the Scandinavian opening since Queen's pawn avoids alot of early checkmate traps that come with king's pawn e4 mirror, and people on the receiving end play it very predictably so you can essentially pre move. They always take with kings pawn, you take with queen and then they always attack queen with their knight and you can slide queen to d5 so that its out of danger but also has a commanding position to lead early queen attacks, nelson style, as well as fall back on a gambit and king's indian

However, although i was finally gaining elo, these strats led to alot of games being very long and drawn out and that was annoying so when i was white, once i got my feet under me more as a player, i started attempting to play Italian game against most things. And now that i was a more experienced player it went alot better for me. It led to very quick games that could go either way but as i slowly got the hang of it i got alot better at playing it and avoiding common traps. I also started integrating the bishop knight fork into my later game strats when i was forced to play more defensive openings. This helped me to realize that one opening doesnt fit all and you have to sort of combine strats and play on your feet.

I am doing a research study looking to analyze a potential correlation between chess skill/rating and quality of mental health. Depending on the results, I may be able to draw conclusions to suggest a potential way for limiting the effects of poor mental health. I have created a survey and am looking for participants willing to fill it out. The survey should only take 1-3 minutes to complete and is easily accessible on Google Forms.

Dont you love floating around 2000 on Lichess even tho  that's probably 1600 on Chess com and even crappier in OTB / FIDE terms?!

I associate Lichess with snobby chess and Chess com with more arcade-y vibes, due to various reasons like sound of pieces, interface and people using said platforms (Eric Rosen vs chess bro streamers). (even tho Eric can try as hard as he wants to be a streamer bro with his funny thumbnails and occasionally suggestive titles, he's still a sweetheart / professor at heart &lt;3).

Of course all of this is purely branding bias in my head, but it makes a material difference on my game... until it doesn't. Eventually, truth catches up and I start playing on Lichess as I would on Chess com — the same interface that made me feel like a gangsta brings on the tilt, so I switch back to Chess com.

Then, the newness of the Chess com interface erases that tilt, and makes me see moves I wouldn't on Lichess. Eventually, that feeling expires too, and so I go back and forth between the two platforms endlessly as I completely ignore my online chess addiction and real life problems.

I really don’t like being down material and it seems like I can’t really make much of this and its too complicated to get the compensation. The one good thing though is players often do Nc6 instead of cxd4 cxd4 Qa5+, and grab the c3 pawn  after d5 which leads to a strong attack on black’s king.

### 🤔 Painting with gummy bears

In December, I got my girlfriend a Haribo advent calendar and treated her with a small bag of gummy bears each day. She LOVES them and especially the green ones (which, did you know, are strawberry flavored in US? [Yep, your life might have been a lie](https://www.foodbeast.com/news/green-strawberry-gummy-bears/)). Being a curious guy, I quickly realized that there are six different bear colors in total and an idea struck me *What if I turned gummy bears into a painting for our living room?*

I know — cool idea bro. But what on earth will this painting *actually* be? At the time, we had recently watched *The Queen’s Gambit* on Netflix and I loved that it caused chess to rise in popularity. I also thought that, from an artistic angle, making a chess painting would combine two worlds together — Haribo gummy bears that kids (and my girlfriend) are crazy about and a board game that is popular among the “slightly older” generation. The only remaining question then: **“What’s the best chess game ever played?”**

### ♟️ The Immortal Game (exclusive)

[The Immortal Game displayed on the German note in 1921.](https://preview.redd.it/ilfio2x5qqj81.jpg?width=2840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cdc27be9de7917a76b552aae346a8bf8ddaf90d)

If you ask this question many chess players, you’ll get a wide range of answers. Having said that, there is one game that just blows my mind in terms of how it travelled through history for 170 years! I mean, even the *Blade Runner* movie referenced it in two of its scenes. It’s called [**The Immortal Game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game). I spent a week searching old websites to collect a unique list of where this match got featured. It's arguably the most famous chess game on record.

&gt;""If there is one game that has been an inspiration to future generations of players - this is it."" - Raymond Keene

So, I decided I’d join a long tradition of being inspired by this game, this time through art with gummy bears.

### 🖼 Behind the scenes &amp; the final art

Alright, the chess game was chosen — what came next? Multiple challenges. Trust me, it was a crazy rollecestor with ups, downs and even more downs!

**&gt;** ***Designing the painting***

The obvious thing was that I needed a ridiculous amount of gummy bears. But how many approximately? My logic was quite simple — the painting should not be larger than 1.5 m x 5 m because otherwise it would be too large for our living room. This means that each chess square should be 0.19 m x 0.19 m or **128 Haribo gummy bears.** Could I design realistic chess figures using that many gummy bears? Let’s see. Apart from the fact that the Knight looks like a lonely unicorn or the Queen seems to be more of a Coronavirus logo, I think I got pretty close. Ok, ok, at least let’s agree that the Rook looks rook-solid!  


https://preview.redd.it/iyggwts8qqj81.png?width=1676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=934b4b132c1753ca05c316b3cfe4050552a5878b

**&gt;** ***Buying gummy bears***

While this seems like the easiest part, believe me or not, getting these gummy bears took me not only driving through all of the petrol stations near by, but literally buying all Haribo packs from the biggest supermarket in the country. Once I met the manager and told her my plan, she was like “Are you insane?”. However, the staff turned out to be very useful and even helped brining all the gummy bears they could find in store. So, yeah, there was at least a single day where absolutely no Haribo gummy bears were available in that supermarket. I hope no kids got too upset!

https://preview.redd.it/5uu0qde9qqj81.png?width=1508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e45262161f5b4f1a00333e7bcf7ae3b0e33474

**&gt;** ***Sorting gummy bears***

While you could order Haribo gummy bears in a single color, sadly, no direct shipment was available to my location and I also had a short deadline for this project. So I put my *Joe Rogan* podcast on and I sorted them into six different colors myself. The biggest challenge was to sort the red and the “pink” ones. I swear, when you spend hours doing it, they start looking absolutely the same!

**&gt;** ***Drying gummy bears***

Oh, and I forgot to mention, these gummy bears shrink. Daily. While obvious now, I did not take this into account at fist. So with some serious convincing of my girlfriend that having 22,000 gummy bears all around a house is a good idea, I kept them in paper bags for around 10 days to dry out. I think I’m still missing at least 1,000 or so. Gone without a trace…

**Final result** \[[Photo 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r001znsnom65b62/Immortal%20Painting%20%281%29.jpeg?dl=0)\] \[[Photo 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/icydpkle17jmte8/Immortal%20Painting%20%282%29.jpeg?dl=0)\] \[[Photo 3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/khl9rffd2gnpbbk/Immortal%20Painting%20%283%29.jpeg?dl=0)\]

Now before we go to the next section, let’s assume that all went fine and here is the final result of a chess art made of no less than **8,192** real gummy bears.  


https://preview.redd.it/3tstoyyaqqj81.png?width=2556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=534b4d03e13e1e2fc5ccfd6738b830e987116bad

### 🔥 Making NFT from a destroyed art

Well, the assumption we made that all went fine is of course not correct! Was the painting curved? Hell, yeah. Did all the gummy bears fit? Absolutely not. Finally, I did make a fundamental mistake of not properly glueing the gummy bears to the surface. To stop them from catching dust, I covered the painting with a blanket before going abroad. However, it’s really massive (**2.0 sq. m**) and it blocked the entrance to our terrace. So, it got walked by several times until it looked like the final portrait from The Picture of Dorian Gray movie…

Having said that, if there is anything I learned about art at school is that it’s about the story and not the paint you put on canvas. And you just read mine. I’ve also recently studied the NFT space and I loved that I could digitalize this piece so that someone else can own it forever (I’m not sure about the gummy bears lasting that long). For me, this is what NFTs stand for — an opportunity to remove the shelf life of art or even bring projects back to life, as in my case. So, I’ve transformed the main picture of the chess painting into a digital form (NFT) and called it the **Immortal Painting** ([**OpenSea link**](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/33609267659946510997299170935593299197761837080736989853821472415553490518017)**)**.

Poll Prompt: Would you say that modern day chess, (queen moving as it is, the promotion rules and the pwn moving two squares up for the first move) changed the game so much, with respect to its predecessors (such as Shatranj, chaturanga, chinese chess and indian chess), that the game today is a new game that never existed before (i.e. before the introduction of the new rules (around the 1500-1600s).

Is there anything notable about this position that's better for White that still results in a significant discrepancy in win rate? Or is this just an example of White playing ""logical"" moves while Black probably has prepared this line?

The [Airthings Masters](https://i.imgur.com/Yjbc0GI.png) tournament kicks off this year’s Meltwater Champions Chess Tour with a glittering lineup featuring Magnus Carlsen and the new open and women's world rapid champions. The first leg of the Tour starts on February 19 with a total prize pot worth up to $150,000, made up of $120,000 for placings and in-game prizes and up to $30,000 available to roll-over into the Tour bonus pot. Overall, the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour — the richest and most prestigious event in online chess — carries a record prize pot of $1.6 million.

Fans watching the Airthings Masters will be treated to a fascinating matchup between world number 1 Carlsen and the teen sensation who beat him to the rapid crown, Nodirbek Abdusattorov. Carlsen, an Airthings Ambassador, will no doubt want to settle his score with the 17-year-old Uzbek. Abdusattorov is one of five prodigiously talented teenagers taking their places in the Tour’s youngest ever line-up, alongside Andrey Esipenko, Praggnanandhaa, Vincent Keymer, and Hans Niemann. Also making her Tour debut is Russian chess queen Alexandra Kosteniuk, who reigns supreme as the new women’s world rapid champion. Both Abdusattorov and Kosteniuk won their titles in December and are bang in form.

Zubair Timol, Vice President of EMEA Meltwater, said: ""Meltwater is excited to see the next generation of chess players participating in the Tour. Similar to Meltwater's approach to developing talent, the Tour gives new players a platform to participate and thrive on, ensuring continued progress and innovation.""

* World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen tops the 16-player field, which will be cut in half by the 4-day round-robin Prelims. The total prize fund is $150,000, with $750 for a win and $250 for a draw in the Prelims. The quarterfinals and semi-finals are 1-day, 4-game matches, while the final will feature two such matches over two days.

* The players have 15 minutes for all their moves, plus a 10-second increment starting from move 1. In the Prelims there are 3 points for a win and 1 for a draw. If a tiebreak is required the players will play two 5+3 games and then, if needed, a single Armageddon game, where White has 5 minutes to Black's 4, but a draw counts as a win for Black. No draw offers are allowed before move 40.

1. Get an advantage but can't convert under time pressure and flag.
2. Spend all my time defending against an attack (often kingside as black) and flag or get mated.

340,40,Carlsen 2900 vs How much will the 125 point lead over #2 players record of Fischer actually be by today's Fide rules ?,"I am not in any shape way or form suggesting that Fischer isnt one of the GOATs along with Kasparov &amp; carlsen.

&amp;#x200B;

Kasparov's highest lead over world no.2 was  82 points in 2000. Carlsens' was 74 points in 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

Fischer had the highest lead 125 points over world no. 2  in july 1972.

&amp;#x200B;

But what i am saying is that when up by 4-0 vs taimanov &amp; up by 4-0 vs bent larsen , by todays rule the remaining 2 games wouldn't have been allowed to play because there is no incentive for the opponent to continue. He has already lost the match of 6 games at 4-0 . 

&amp;#x200B;

So by todays fide rules , fischer would have got 8-0 sweep &amp; not a 12-0 sweep. In july 1972 list he had that record 125 point  2785 after dominating      

The candidates  which dropped to 2780 in january 1973 list after the WC match.

&amp;#x200B;

So i have 2 questions :

Wouldnt fischer's lead over #2 be somewhat lesser than 125 point lead by today's rules which are more sensible rules anyways. ? Still that would be higher than Kasparov's  &amp; carlsen's lead i guess.

&amp;#x200B;

If Carlsen crosses 2900 would that be considered  

Above fischer's 125 point lead over #2 for deciding who dominated their contemporaries  the more when at their peak performances  ?",0,118,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

The thread cites a Russian post (translated by google):

&gt;I asked Viktor Zakharov about the tables. He replied that the tables were attacked by hackers and require a very round sum for restoration. It is possible to restore it yourself, but it is extremely laborious.

*Background:* These bases could be used for free via the Lomonosov 7-man Android app; and also via a paid API sold by chessok.com .   

The Lomonosov format takes more storage space than the Syzygy format offered by Lichess and others,  but the point of difference is that it reports the Distance to Mate for each winning position, whereas Syzygy reports Distance to Zeroing (i.e. distance to a pawn move or capture). 

Both methods are interesting;  the DTZ is handy if the 50-move rule is a factor (although still leaves some work to be done as there might be a gap of more than 50 occurring after some captures);  while the DTM will always give the shortest line to mate.",0,59,8,-0.5574,0.434,0.566,0.0

359,59,Eric Hansen lost on purpose,"Eric Hansen lost on purpose

Everyone with a brain knows Hansen deliberately lost to give the women player her only “win”. Was it pity or did someone pressure him to do it? He beats Magnus and Nepo then loses to the worst player who happens to be a woman? He somehow “blunders” a back rank tactic that even 700s can see? Eric gave her the win because it didn’t matter as he was already qualifying. He probably felt sorry for her because of her abysmal record. A 2600 GM who’s exceptional at low time odds doesn’t “blunder” a back rank tactic as simple as that. 

I’m willing bet everything I own that Eric Hansen threw the game on purpose for the ”women” to win. Everyone knows how much better he is, and he's just beaten the world champion and his runner up without breaking a sweat and now he’s suddenly losing to the worst player in the field and it just so happens that she’s a woman?



Can’t pinpoint the reason he lost deliberately and what his incentive was It’s a shame as it’s clear as the light of day that a female like Kostenik or whatever her name gets invited to play in a field that has top male players that are a billion times more talented than her because of her gender. 



And to quote Bobby Fischer: “They're all weak, all women. They're stupid compared to men. They shouldn't play chess, you know.”

An opening position I quite often reach in my games is a set-up as after 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Be3 Bb4 7. Bd3.

In this position, and other Sicilian set-ups like it, the engine tends to hate 7...Bxc3+, exchanging the bishop for the knight. I find this odd. I'm intuitively inclined to play that move because it gives my opponent isolated doubled pawns, and when I'm white I avoid this position for that exact reason.

In Nimzo-Indian set-ups, on the other hand, exchanging off the bishop for the knight on c3 is apparently fine, although it often doesn't create doubled pawns at all, let alone isolated ones.

I find this difference between these openings counter-intuitive. Could someone help me understand what explains it? What is undesirable about the bishop trade in the Sicilian set-up shown above?",0,52,11,0.2382,0.0,0.837,0.163

377,77,Are longer time controls also better for improving at blitz?,"Hello chess community,

I am trying to decide on the best use of my time in chess.

There is the common wisdom that to improve at chess you need to play long games to develop accurate and thorough calculation abilities. This is obviously true for playing classical. Playing blitz games will build bad habits and not give you the skills necessary to win a classical game. 

But what if the goal is to be better at blitz? I want to perform better at lichens arena tournaments, and these are simply better at lower TC for various reasons. If I strive to improve my 5+0 ability, am I wasting my time or even doing harm by following the old advice of playing long games?

I was able to come up with this pro/con list.

Reasons long games might be detrimental to blitz:
-relying on calculating everything might diminish trust in my instincts
-taking too long to move/time management

Reasons long games might benefit blitz:
-common positions out of the opening might become familiar with deeper understanding
-better calculation abilities in general could make calculating in Blitz faster
-avoiding bad habits and thereby developing better instincts

What can you add to this list? Have you found it beneficial to play long games even if your main focus is getting good ad blitz? Why?/Why not?

I registered the account early this year as a practice account to online club plays such as ChessDojo. MY UCSF rating is 1600's, not high, but I have always been really good at tactics. I tried my hand at TT, and got 2400 after like 200 puzzles, and did one try of puzzle rush casually, getting 35. BTW I also have a puzzle rating of above 2400 on lichess, and my peak chesstempo classical tactics are 2200. My stats are by no means stellar, but I just want to say that I know how to play chess! Anyway, I started playing 10min games, usually a couple of them in the evenings. I had to adjust to playing online in the beginning, so lost a few. And then I got used to playing on the screen, so my rating steadily went up, reaching 1700's from 800 when I first signed up. Those games were NOT of good quality, at all, at least not by my standard, as I am really really poor in openings, but usually win because opponents blunder. And, as many of you know, 10min 1700 rating on [chess.com](https://chess.com) is just not that high, at all!!! Well, guess what, my account was closed today, with no details offered. The only reason that I can think of is that I have won several games in a row last night, but my accuracy in all of them is low, in the 70 to 80% range, and I am usually losing in the opening, for the reason I mentioned earlier. I am so angry and upset for this! I just fired off an appeal, but don't know if they are willing to discuss any evidence. This is just so ridiculous.",0,31,4,-0.5093,0.523,0.477,0.0

If you win a game where you initially lost to a tactic or some staregy but your opponent blundered back a whole piece, what was the learning curve? I just played someone in Fischer random who despite being down the exchange and 3 pawns, decided to keep playing, wasting my time, then decided to keep playing after further losing his queen to a rook pin in the endgame, totalling a loss of 9 points in material and probably multiples more in position. Are you seriously just hoping your opponent gets butter fingers and hangs a piece so you can boost your rating? Then, let me ask, is your rating increase really a reflection of your performance that game or a result of successfully playing 'hope chess' where you wish the opponent to make some kind of extreme blunder. I can understand playing down a few pawns, a piece as well if there is compensation. But when there is almost no or little compensation for a heavy material loss, why play on except if you just naturally prefer to play until checkmate, which in that case seems fine to me.",0,41,7,0.2584,0.0,0.747,0.253

385,85,Gauging the effectiveness of home-brew vision drills,"I'm pretty new to chess, and recently I've been trying to improve my board vision and calculation depth, while hopefully opening up the possibility of studying chess books without a board handy. I'm running De Maza's vision drills and exercises from Holtzhausen's Visualwize (among other things), but I felt like there was something missing, so I started developed a new drill:

1. While your eyes are closed, have friend randomly place some number of pieces on a board (which pieces and the number of pieces depend on your skill level) and have them tell you the pieces and their positions. If you don't have a friend, an 8-sided die will do the trick.
2. Keeping your eyes closed call out all of the squares that are seen by more than one piece.

For example: If the board is configured Qc5, Be2, and Ng6, the squares seen by two or more pieces are b5, c4, e5, e7, f8, and h5.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's the rub. Is this drill actually productive? Would it be more or equally productive if I was looking at a blank board during the drill? I'm getting better, but am I actually getting better at board vision, or just the drill? How does one even measure the effectiveness of a drill when it is just part of a broader training schedule!?

I moved my pawn from E2 to E1, making him a queen (shown in yellow). It's now the opponent's turn. Even if the rook kills that newly-crowned queen, it's still check from the original queen (D2). Shouldn't the game be over? And what happens after the opponent moves? I didn't get to see it as the opponent left/abandoned the game.

I decided to start a new account where I played the games out OTB only looking at the online game to see the move my opponent made and to make my own move trying really hard to not let myself analyze the position on my phone screen. I found this to be so much more enjoyable than just playing the games online. I played both bots and against people for months OTB without paying online until I got my rating and conquered bots to the same level as my main online account. Also all of my opening study has been done OTB which has made me retain the information so much more.

445,46,Bullet Chess = Cocaine?,"Bullet chess (1+0) is extremely fun and addicting, and I liken it to the cocaine of the internet. It tests your ability to ""hustle"" and adapt quickly to fluid situations, a skill I think is very important in life. Nonetheless, I think bullet is probably detrimental to your chess improvement for 99% of players.

Through Lichess's Chess Insights I have discovered that, despite my cheap mouse, I am particularly adept at flagging my opponent (often in losing positions) for my rating. Nearly 60% of my wins in bullet in a recent sample of 164 games have been a result of the opponent's timeout. Many other wins I have come from cheap tactical swindles despite being positionally outplayed for most of the game. This seems to contribute to the fact that my bullet rating is nearly the same as my rapid rating (2100-2200ish), when for most other players their rapid rating is much higher than their bullet rating. I have no illusions about my actual chess skill, nor do I have illusions about bullet improving my game. I am often dead lost in many of my bullet games. I consider myself a very dishonorable player, and some of the bullet games that I won can probably go in a history book for dirtiest flags ever. If there were an Olympic event for chess flagging, I could probably qualify for the prelims, though of course I won't win any medals (probably Andrew Tang or Naroditsky gets gold I guess).

To be honest bullet chess is kind of like cocaine, and the rush of being on the edge of death in a bullet game where you are down tons of material and your king is running around naked in his underwear is  some really dank stuff. Nigel Short was right, bullet rots the brain as much as alcohol. Since I do sincerely want to impove my chess, I probably will try to go cold turkey on bullet and start focusing more on serious longer games. I am curious about what others think of bullet.

482,83,"Can't seem to improve, even if playing every day and studying openings. Help :-)","Hello everyone, maybe someone here can help me, or maybe this happened to you, and you can tell me what you did to fix it. 

I was playing every day Rapid 45 min 45 increment on [chess.com](https://chess.com) until I reached 1796 about year ago. 

Then my rating went down, and I decided to switch to Rapid 30 minutes with 0 increment, because I was sometimes waiting for more than half an hour for a game.

I got back to 1720 to 1730 a couple of times since then but mostly my rating as been 1650 to 1700 since then. 

Then lately, in the last month, after reaching again 1730, I now went back to almost 1600, I lost over 100 rating points in one month. I just lost to a 1575 fair and square.

Here is my profile, in case someone wants to have a look - [https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/vascocavalheiro/365](https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/vascocavalheiro/365)

I keep studying openings, keep watching YouTube videos but can't seem to improve in the last year, and have even regressed. I struggle with time trouble and am constantly down on time against almost everybody.

I play the Philidor Black Lion with black against e4, and it has been working well even now. I play the Jobava London with white, but I'm having second thoughts about that opening.

I used to play the Old Indian 1 d6 against white d4, but have recently switched into a main line opening, the queen's gambit declined. In the hopes that playing some more main line openings will improve my chess. still getting used to the QGD but I like it, I play Ragozin at least I get good fighting chances.

I know that I'm a much better chess player now than a year ago, I know my openings a lot better, so I don't understand what's going on.

My reasoning for playing off beat openings was always that at least I'm getting people into my theory, where I get a knowledge and experience advantage everytime. But I'm starting to think that this was not a good long-term strategy.

Or it has nothing to do with the openings, and it's just normal rating fluctuations, it's just chess and in the next 6 months I'll be back to the high 1700s. But that does not seem feasible in this faster time control.

With no increment games, you really need to keep moving otherwise you will be flagged in a winning position every time. 

Maybe it's just the time control, I haven't gotten used to it and it just doesn't favor me.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, not improving and even regressing for over a year?

Did you switch openings from more off beat openings to more main line, did it help?

If you were in a similar situation, what did you do to fix it?

Black simply has too many ways to neutralize my attacks. The modern defense, the Fischer defense, Falkbeer CG(which is basically the modern defense,) easily stops whatever I’m doing, and these openings are easy to book up.

The same goes for the very dubious Latvian. 

I’m planning to switch to more traditional openings like the Ruy and the Italian and the Scotch, however I was wondering if you guys can recommend me some e4 openings that are aggressive like the KG and the Latvian.

492,93,Does your opponent's rating affect your decisions? Should it? Should it not?,"Got to thinking based on lichess' [zen mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/qx7zju) (official [here](https://lichess.org/page/zen)) and this comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/qndkou) (can't link directly):

&gt;All of the information you need to make those decisions is on the board and clock. The opponent's rating has nothing to do with it.

**I think I disagree with completely ignoring opponent's rating when making decisions.**

&amp;#x200B;

1stly, I think it's necessary to know if my opponent's rating is higher or lower.

* This way I know I *have to* play for a win, namely whenever my opponent's rating is lower.

2ndly, I think it's necessary to know *how much* higher or lower to evaluate eg cases involving draws:

1. I'm offered a draw by a much higher rated opponent. [Should I accept?](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/reinpe/was_this_the_position_white_to_move_for_the_last/)
2. I'm winning but can force a draw against a much higher rated opponent. It's hard to convert this win. Should I force the draw?
3. I'm up 1 or even 2 pawns against a much higher rated opponent (eg [move 21](https://www.chess.com/game/live/15429128235)). But it's really hard to convert this win. Or there's still room for error. Should I offer a draw?
4. I am slightly losing, but [I think I can manage a draw](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/sxtp2w/couldnt_think_of_a_way_to_win_this_chess960_game/hxu0l6x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (position [here](https://lichess.org/analysis/r1q5/pp3k1p/1bp2n2/5P2/8/5Q2/PPPR1PPP/2K3B1_w_-_-_0_1)). But my opponent is much lower rated, so maybe I can still play for a win. Should I play for a win (whether or not I am offered a draw) ?

I think there are other cases about not draws specifically but like

* evaluating sacrifices/trades
* deciding to abandon middlegame attacks for slightly winning endgames or something.

But anyway, I'm just focusing on draws for example cases above. **Your answer doesn't have to be about draws.**

Finally, there's a saying

&gt;The hardest game to win is a won game. (Emanuel Lasker?)

&amp;#x200B;

Appendix

I believe Josh Waitzkin talks about this somewhere in h [chessmaster endgame series](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ouh61n/resources_on_practical_endgame_after_josh/) but specifically for trade offers from much higher rated opponents:

* If you're offered a trade into a simpler endgame by a much higher rated opponen[t](https://www.reddit.com/r/umineko/comments/sqbsyn/comment/hwzcm38/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), then there's a psychological aspect in that, because you respect your opponent, you tend to just assume your opponent has calculated correctly.

I’m an intermediate-ish player (1750 lichess rapid, 1450 chess dot com rapid), and I play mostly 15+10 games. I have noticed that many (probably half) of my opponents in this time control at this level tend to make their moves *way* too quickly. For 15+10 games, for example, we will be on move 30 and my opponent will still have over 15 minutes on their clock. Just don’t know why someone would seek out a 15+10 game if they’re going to play like it’s a 3+2 game. I know there’s obviously no rule saying you *have* to use more time, and you can use time however you’d like, but I’m forced to believe that players like this would see a big increase in rating if they would just take a minute to calculate in critical positions. I’m not an expert/master so I’m in no position to give actual chess advice, and I’m sure you’ve all heard this before at some point, but it’s an easy thing to implement that would probably help tremendously if you are a player who plays like this.

I decided to create a simulation for the rest of the Grand Prix to determine how likely the various outcomes were.

I'm hoping to keep this simulation updated every day after the Grand Prix action (and maybe for future tournaments as well, if there is interest)

**After 300,000 simulations, I found that Hikaru has a 52.1% chance of qualifying for the Candidates.**

You can read some more details about this and see everyone's chances here: [https://pawnalyze.com/tournament/2022/02/21/nakamura-likely-to-qualify-for-candidates-2022.html](https://pawnalyze.com/tournament/2022/02/21/nakamura-likely-to-qualify-for-candidates-2022.html)

Lonewolf is managed on a Slack server, which all participants must join. The server also hosts many great side leagues and groups: The main Lichess 4545 team league, 3+2 Blitz, 15+10 Rapid, 90+30 Classical, 960chess, BookClub, ThemeBrawl and more! (Note: It is only possible to join the  community through the Lonewolf or Lichess4545 leagues, but once joined you may freely apply to the side-leagues - acceptance is subject to the approval of each league/group's rules of course).

Lonewolf aligns itself with the rules and regulations of Lichess and entries are vetted accordingly.

523,24,Cheating is way more common in online chess than people realize,"I didn't realize this needed to be said, but there's a post on the front page right now claiming there's not that much cheating, so I feel like I need to say this.

Cheating is WAY more common than you think. Here's why.

1. Online chess cites have an incentive to lie about how many people they estimate are cheating. If they tell you there aren't many cheaters, you are more likely to play on their site. If they tell you there are many cheaters, you're less likely to play. It's that simple, really. I suspect some sites are lying intentionally, others are withholding information, and yet others just have a subconscious bias in favor of their own ability to get rid of cheaters.
2. Most cheating is undetectable, since most cheating is not cheating on every move going for 99 % accuracy like some dumbass. Most cheaters use it only when they need to, in a difficult part of the game where they're under pressure and need to find a winning move. There's no way any cheat detection system can detect that. This effectively means that it is IMPOSSIBLE to ""estimate"" how many cheaters there are, since those estimates are based on the people that got caught, and the people that got caught aren't representatitve of this ""smarter"" class of cheaters. 
3. It's easy. You can download programs that cheat, or, make one yourself, and yes, there are ones available for bullet chess as well, so ""speed"" is not a limitation. The good ol' method of having an engine running on a separate browser and manually inputting every single move is NOT the way most cheating works.
4. The amount of so-called ""smurfing"" and ""upsets"" that you see, aren't actual smurfs or upsets. They're cheaters. Think about it, if you're enough of a prick to ""smurf"", why wouldn't you just take the next step and cheat at your own, actual rating? People that are so lacking in class that they need to smurf, would just cheat.",0,63,11,-0.5574,0.265,0.735,0.0

This creates a skewed incentive to win and leads to people *trying* to win the game by playing more ""exciting""  rather than just trying to play risk free and draw. 

In chess, I think either this or making winning/drawing with black slightly more beneficial (since white has a slight advantage) will also lead to people playing/exploring more sharp lines. This can also be a natural tie breaker (player with more black wins/draws will have a slightly bigger score).",0,210,37,0.8848,0.0,0.738,0.262

It's the first time I've ever watched contestants on a stage - either live or in a film.

In the film, the White pieces are always on the left of the table as seen by the audience.

Therefore the players changed seats for each game.

Is that the normal procedure?

I have bumbled my way to a rating around 1000 on chess.com, and would still consider myself a beginner...hence this question.

One dumbass simple tactic that keeps succeeding against me is when my opponent waits until I castle kingside (which I do early 'cause I'm scared), then they castle queenside and begin to advance their stupid moron pawns. I address the issue early, but it always seems to succeed in jacking up my castled structure and next thing you know I have a queen and a knight in my face preparing to checkmate and I'm like...""this guy is not that good but he's going to win"" and then he (she!??) does.

Its a flat out improvement to the Danish gambit since it avoids the insta-draw line.

Its far more dangerous for black compared to the scotch gambit.

its far less dangerous for white compared to the kings gambit.

The development and plans for white are very straightforward and black has to be very careful not to fall into any traps. Black can decline the gambit and get a quieter game but white still enjoys a comfortable position with initiative.

573,74,Lost and found: Eric Rosen (IMROSEN),"So, a couple weeks ago, I noticed a lack of new content from an otherwise prolific content creator: International Master, Eric Rosen (IMROSEN). He had stopped posting to his \[YouTube\](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXy10-NEFGxQ3b4NVrzHw1Q), hadn’t appeared on his \[twitch stream\](https://www.twitch.tv/imrosen), and had seemingly vanished from the interwebs. 

While I enjoy his YouTube channel &amp; occasionally watch him on twitch, I don’t really consider myself a close follower of his. As such, I figured it likely he had probably indicated (somewhere else) where/why he’d gone and, in my reddit naivety, I made a post asking about it. 

Of course, this was an asinine move and the hordes immediately assumed I was calling for a manhunt, lacked object permanence, and simply needed to relax/chill. Levy (u/Gothamchess) even took the opportunity to claim he’d abducted our mild-mannered IM, while at the same time mimicking (mocking?) the post title syntax. I’ll take the opportunity here to say ""Congrats"", Mr. Rozman, on the recent nuptials &amp; new puppy. My sympathies for the lack of sleep. If you ever plan on having children, consider the experience an excellent preview. 

But I digress, Eric has since posted \[an explainer to his YouTube\](https://youtu.be/6B-FF9-H2No), highlighting my ill-conceived post, and letting us all know he’d just gotten burnt out and needed a break. He even shared with us how he’d spent some time traveling, visited his parents, and caught a cold (not covid) playing with their new dog. He also revealed the existence of a 2nd, lesser known, YouTube channel, \[Eric Rosen Extra\](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1xMgtkHA0fIVdABCrUIww).

Anyway, I just wanted to say: 

Eric,    

My apologies for creating the kerfuffle. I stupidly thought I was asking an innocent question. As with many of my moves in chess, this was a mistake.  My bad, dude. I hope your break was restful and restorative.  Keep on keepin on.

Also.... to Levy,    

Just cause Eric shares pics of his parents fun new puppy, doesn’t mean you have to rush right out and get one. You’re unique and special already, man. You’re good enough. You’re smart enough and, gosh darn it, people like you (even in that pink hoodie).",0,36,6,-0.3182,0.315,0.685,0.0

1.) over explaining it, making it seem like a game of memorization and looking at the pieces 30 min before a move
or

I've been playing chess a long time (10+ years on and off), have decent instincts, do well on puzzles, but have never had the patience (or motivation) to learn theory – until now!

Three questions:

1. What openings / lines would you suggest I start learning to wet my feet in the vast, life-giving ocean of opening theory? I usually play / am most comfortable playing King's Pawn openings and some kind of homebrew French Sicilian...what lines of these should I experiment with or disregard? What should I add to my toolbox?
2. Which openings / lines have you found easiest and most exciting / engaging / fruitful to learn and why? Bonus points if you're not much of a theory head (or weren't much of one when you first dipped into these openings / lines).
3. What resources would you suggest for training my brain to digest theory better?

In my country backgammon is a game played by literally 80% of the people and so i know how to handle myself in that game. However backg is more a game based on luck on the dices then anything else. You can have the best moves, if you don’t get to play them it’s useless. Now backgammon is truly easy to understand compared to chess. Chess is so big and it honestly feels like a maze that I don’t even want to get lost in. I always want to start learning the basics but I always feel to dumb. Like i get disoriented by seeing a chess board that isn’t numbered. And when I watch people play blindfolded it always takes me a second to see where a pawn goes. I feel like i lack the insight and just general intellect of a good chess player. I feel like i want to learn it, but i also don’t want to study the game for 8 hours long each day just to get a 2k elo for example.

***

The [Airthings Masters](https://i.imgur.com/CrPmjgO.png) tournament kicks off this year’s Meltwater Champions Chess Tour with a glittering lineup featuring Magnus Carlsen and the new open and women's world rapid champions. The first leg of the Tour starts on February 19 with a total prize pot worth up to $150,000, made up of $120,000 for placings and in-game prizes and up to $30,000 available to roll-over into the Tour bonus pot. Overall, the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour — the richest and most prestigious event in online chess — carries a record prize pot of $1.6 million.

Fans watching the Airthings Masters will be treated to a fascinating matchup between world number 1 Carlsen and the teen sensation who beat him to the rapid crown, Nodirbek Abdusattorov. Carlsen, an Airthings Ambassador, will no doubt want to settle his score with the 17-year-old Uzbek. Abdusattorov is one of five prodigiously talented teenagers taking their places in the Tour’s youngest ever line-up, alongside Praggnanandhaa, Vincent Keymer, and Hans Niemann. Also making her Tour debut is Russian chess queen Alexandra Kosteniuk, who reigns supreme as the new women’s world rapid champion. Both Abdusattorov and Kosteniuk won their titles in December and are bang in form.

Zubair Timol, Vice President of EMEA Meltwater, said: ""Meltwater is excited to see the next generation of chess players participating in the Tour. Similar to Meltwater's approach to developing talent, the Tour gives new players a platform to participate and thrive on, ensuring continued progress and innovation.""

####**Format**

* World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen tops the 16-player field, which will be cut in half by the 4-day round-robin Prelims. The total prize fund is $150,000, with $750 for a win and $250 for a draw in the Prelims. The quarterfinals and semi-finals are 1-day, 4-game matches, while the final will feature two such matches over two days.

* The players have 15 minutes for all their moves, plus a 10-second increment starting from move 1. In the Prelims there are 3 points for a win and 1 for a draw. If a tiebreak is required the players will play two 5+3 games and then, if needed, a single Armageddon game, where White has 5 minutes to Black's 4, but a draw counts as a win for Black. No draw offers are allowed before move 40.

||For fun, I know chess is just a game an not realistic||

So you know how pawns can make it to the other end of the board to get promoted to queen? This means that pawns by definition are women. This isn't that big of a deal until you remember that Knights, Rooks, and Bishops would also be women since they come from pawns. The bishop one is literally impossible since bishops by christian law can't be women, and back when the game was created even more so. This all means that every chess piece is a woman except for the king. However, the king makes even less sense in this context. Not because the king should be a women, but because of how it moves. It's so weak, it moves so slowly. This gives us right to assume the king is an old ass man, or has a bad condition in his legs. This means that, according to simple pawn promotion, all the chess pieces are women fighting to defend their old ass hooker guy from another old ass hooker guy's army of women.

However, I wasn't actually interested in playing, and still got what I wanted out of it and left the screen to do what I liked in the meantime. 

Anyway...

I'd intentionally blunder a bunch of my pieces through stupid pre-moves. Obviously making it clear I was just mucking around and had no intention of playing seriously. 

Often I'd be left with just my King and a few pawns and they'd still have all their pieces. 

I'd then offer a draw, and keep offering one until they accept. Putting about 30 seconds into this until they stop pressing ""no"" and then I can't offer anymore and I just go and carry on with my life. 

Guess how many people instead chose to run down the clock from 10 mins and presumably either ""teach me a lesson"", or just really really badly want the game to say ""you won""? 

ALL EXCEPT FOR 1 OUT OF 30 OR SO!!

Why not just either resign or draw and continue on with a another game?

For now it allows to convert pgn files to latex using xskak and skak. There is an example of a lichess study on the Stafford Gambit (Eric Rosen &lt;3) as a book: 

[https://github.com/icannos/pgn2tex/blob/master/examples/stafford.pdf](https://github.com/icannos/pgn2tex/blob/master/examples/stafford.pdf).

It can also generate books of puzzle using the lichess puzzles database ([https://database.lichess.org/](https://database.lichess.org/)) but it still need some refinements.

869,70,Brenda Tersine (Goicheberg) passes away at 78,"Brenda worked the registration desks many of the continental chess association tournaments passed away and services are being held for her today.

I had the pleasure of meeting her a few times, and I always thought she was very kind and patient. She always made sure to get people their free/reduced parking waivers for the hotels at any tournaments that offered them. 

From http://www.chesstour.com/refs.html :

Brenda Tersine (Goichberg)

1948-2022



My heart is heavy with grief. The light of my life is gone.
My wonderful wife Brenda passed away Feb 11 after an illness that had mostly confined her to bed for the past year. She had appeared to be recovering lately, making her passing even more of a shock.

For almost 40 years, Brenda worked the registration table at many CCA events, receiving late entries, byes and withdrawals. We traveled together to almost every part of the USA. While I was usually preoccupied with various tasks and issues that arise at a big tournament, she never failed to visit a nearby food outlet and appear with my lunch or dinner and remind me that I had to eat.
She had a great sense of humor.


Brenda was born in Punxsutawney, PA, home of the legendary groundhog. Before becoming a chess director, she was a certified Funeral Director, at a time when that was almost an all male field.

She was a pioneer in funeral service, becoming Punxsutawney’s first woman Funeral Director in 1971.
She was the first woman in Pennsylvania to be certified to do eye enucleations for corneal transplants. She was Oliver H. Bair’s first licensed woman embalmer &amp; Funeral Director in Philadelphia in 1976.

She was the first woman embalming assistant professor at Hudson Valley Community College in 1982, and trained many of the current funeral directors in New York state.

She contributed to the Embalming textbook written by Robert J, Mayer in 1990.  She also did K-12 substitute teaching.

Brenda was a 1966 graduate of Punxsutawney HS, a 1970 graduate of Indiana University of PA with a B.S. in Social Science Education, a 1971 graduate of the Pittsburgh Intitute of Mortuary Science, and a 1985 graduate of SUNY at Albany with a Masters degree in Advanced Classroom Teaching.

Services are expected to be Thursday, Feb 17, 2 pm at Flynn Funeral Home in Monroe, NY.
Please send any donations to the US Chess Federation.


Rest in peace sweetie, there are no words to express how much I miss you.

889,90,Adult Improver - 3 years of steady playing - from 500 to 1900 - Motivational Post,"Progression chart (the flat periods are mostly me switching to lichess but the big one in 2020 was me just taking a break):

https://preview.redd.it/zf6y8szt1ei81.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78cfc18b8ac7171d87ab4b79eaf91e9dad298cb7

This is a pretty big milestone for me. I'm less than 100 points away from my ultimate goal of 2000 and I can't believe I got here. I remember simply wanting a 4 digit rating and now I'm here.

I'll be honest, I didn't do things the ""right"" way but I wanted to show that big improvement can happen if you put the time and effort into it. It didn't happen overnight and I've had many ups and downs. I know when you're on tilt or you're simply just starting out it can seem daunting but keep at it. You can do it!

So, aside from playing blitz, what did I do over these last 3 years of playing?

* Watch plenty of chess videos. I started off with John Bartholomew's Climbing the Rating Ladder series and watched pretty much everyone there is to watch from there but if I had to credit a sole person, JB would have to be the one I pick. That said, I love pretty much everyone out there!
* Switch time formats. Switching from bullet, to rapid and sometimes classical kept my interest going. I'd also switch between lichess and [chess.com](https://chess.com) just to mix things up.
* Puzzles. I'll be honest, I don't do them consistently, but I'll get into periods where I'll just binge puzzles for a few weeks and not touch them again for months at a time.
* Analysis. If I notice I keep losing to certain openings I'll do some research and find the best response. A recent example of this is the Tal variation of the CK. I was just getting smoked whenever I encountered it and I've managed to take the edge off it for the most part. Still can get me occasionally so it's something I'll invest more time into.
* Playing the engine in won positions. If an opponent resigns in a losing position, I'll often play the position out against the engine to see if I can convert it. If I'm not up a lot of material, or if the position isn't easy to navigate then my chances are pretty poor but otherwise it gives me a challenge and gives me practice sharpening up certain techniques. For example, I've improved a lot in endgames where it's KRvKR and some pawns. I used to blunder all my pawns all the time, but I've improved on that somewhat thanks to this.
* Practicing coordinates, knight maneuvers and tricky mates (e.g. KNBvK).

Lastly, you might be curious as to how much time I spent on chess? This is probably going to be the biggest roadblock for people I think so I'll say that upfront. I would say the first year or so I was playing a few hours a day and since then it's been up and down depending on my mood. Overall, I would say it's still somewhere in the vicinity of 10-20 hours a week of playing when I'm active, but I do take more regular breaks now than I did in the beginning.

Feel free to ask me any questions, I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination but I can give you my 2 cents based on my experience.

Lastly, I hope this encourages others to keep at it. I know there's a lot of talk about how adults specifically shouldn't expect much in the way of improvement, but I wanted to show that your fate isn't necessarily sealed (I'm in my early 30s for reference).",0,81,16,0.5574,0.0,0.685,0.315

&amp;#x200B;

My opponent played the only winning move

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!12. Qb5!! !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, that move made me tear up. here I was , just playing a Tartokower Caro Kann, trying to remember whatever my coach told me in the weekend about pawn structures , when to transition into endgames, where the fuck to put my light squared bishop, thinking how my knight's future seemed bleaker than my own. ""..Qa5, Kb1 and then what?"" is what kept ringing in my mind

&amp;#x200B;

When my opponent played &gt;!Qb5!&lt;, I knew this was no normal man. I mean, come on, what a move! &gt;!hitting that rook on e8, either exchanging queens or pathetically playing Qd8 back!&lt;...not only worrying about my pathetic minor pieces but also the fuckin queen.&gt;! If I take the queen, then Knight jumps happily into b5...then onto c7 to win . So Na6? Runs into Bb7 winning the b7 pawn. If I play Rb8? Bf4! boom! Move your rook and now knight lands on c7 winning a rook etc.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Okay so I played QxQ , NxQ , Na6 Bg2....and then I was going to resign when I played ...Rb8 and when he played Bf4. But this guy went one step further...here he played the even more stunning Bxa7 (I know it's obvious now but Bf4 looked way more human when I was calculating after the earth shattering move Qb5.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a decent player by any means. I have been rated \~1800 in the past, now 1526, losing week in week out, in a massive tilt (and hence hired the aforementioned coach to help me out of this rut). But to me &gt;!Qb5 !&lt;looks a GM level move (might I add, it's the only winning move in the position, everything else is less than +1). Please tell me if I am overreacting or if I witnessed the rise of the new Magnus Carlsen .

Firstly on my [chess.com](https://chess.com) account I'm rated 200 elo lower in all time formats than I am on lichess, this is because lichess inflates their elo calculation to make you feel good. You're not 2000 rated, in reality you're probably 1700 - 1800 rated.

Secondly you're not \[x% better than others\]([https://i.gyazo.com/083b91819b71c6ae34dab4cbd802b563.png](https://i.gyazo.com/083b91819b71c6ae34dab4cbd802b563.png)), you're x% better than every single person who has ever created an account and played a few matches and then quit never to return again. The amount of players who create an account without even knowing the rules, play a few games and then quit forever is monstrous. Unfortunately these peoples elo gets tossed into the stat once again giving users an inflated score.

Lastly lichess likes to use a weird elo calculation algorithm where you'll play someone the same elo as you and if you win you gain like 8 points, but if you lose you only lose 5 points. Again this is to keep your inflated elo bumped up, for what reason? God only knows...

&amp;#x200B;

I really wish the creator would stop with these shenanigans and just rate players accurately and to stop inflating all the stats. If you really want to know what your elo is, go on [chess.com](https://chess.com) or play OTB and get a real life rating.

951,52,Daniel Naroditsky Appreciation Post,"In my chess journey so far, a number of streamers have had an influence on my ability to progress. I love Agadmator's dry humour and his positional explanations. I love Levy's instructional videos on openings (this is what probably helped me break 1100) and his breakdowns of master level games. John Bartholomew is also great and I've learned a lot of things from him. Hikaru has some interesting content.

But it's not really that surprising to me that the most helpful from a learning perspective as a beginner that two people who have professionally tutored players are the best teachers and I've learned the most from. The biggest influence being Daniel Naroditsky.

I've since climbed out of my 1100 pit and i'm now a 1400/1950 (chess/lichess) rapid player and while i'm still VERY much a beginner and have SO MUCH more to learn, I think it's Danya who changed my perspective on how I play and how I analyze the board that made the biggest difference. Sure, I was doing puzzles, practicing openings, and playing rated and unrated games at longer time controls and Blitz - but I genuinely think the biggest change came from Danya. I think he's a fantastic, maybe the best, role model for what a chess player should practice being (or at least try to, when not tilted, which happens to the best of us). 

The way he breaks down the positions in his speedrun videos has been CRAZY helpful - maybe THE most helpful thing - in me understanding chess as a beginner. He approaches it in a way that I've not really found that anyone else does, in that he asks you questions and explains why players are playing good and why they are playing bad and instead of blitzing through all the possible moves, he explains one or two ideas in a better way. Maybe this is just me, but this style of breakdown feels REALLY valuable to me. To me, I think he has been the single best influence on my improvement in chess.

He also changed the way I view other players. If you've watched his speedruns, you know what I mean. I used to always think everyone was cheating or whatever, just being a bad sport. Danya is humble, acknowledges when his opponents are playing well, never outright accuses anyone of cheating and even talks his chat down from accusations. He always repeats something along the lines of (paraphrasing) ""How would you feel if you were playing the game of your life just to be accused of cheating?"". This happened to me the other week as I was playing in a swiss tournament and was second place in the last game playing third place and before the game started he typed in chat ""turn off the engine or you're being reported"" and yeah, Danya's right, that made me feel like shit. Now i just acknowledge when my opponent is playing well and i say so and it's led to a lot of great interactions and friend requests and i'm a much happier person. 

Daniel has had a huge influence on how I play and how I view chess and I couldn't thank him enough. Maybe when he's next on twitch i'll pop in and gift some subs or something, i dunno. It would be hard to communicate the gratitude I have.

If you haven't seen them, do yourself a favour and watch his speedrun videos, this is his latest one (although he's only up to about 1400): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT1F2nOxLHOeyyw85utYJpWtSmxvA-2WR

I’ve just returned to OTB soon. I feel like I want to mix it up with an opening.

I’m fine playing Reti/KIA for white and getting comfortable positions (or kingside attacks.) 

I like the KID for 1. D4. Has a lot of theory, but, in practice I know how to play these.

For 1. E4 I have traditionally played the Pirc/Modern. Up until current level (1900 USCF), I’ve gotten decent positions and results. 

I’m finding that white is playing the setups I don’t like counterattacking. This is especially true against 2100 and 2200s. 

What’s the “easiest” Sicilian to learn and play. I used to play the Accelerated Dragon and don’t mind the Bind. I’ve messed around with the Kan, but don’t know it well.

And, while these things are critical components, it seems asinine to suggest that spatial intelligence is not also a critical component to be a top player.

In canteens, some prefects and even almost all teachers are fine with it, but some are super picky, and will ask us for a permission slip to play or we can't play it. I've previously asked for one from a senior assistant but him and the Principal don't allow it. I'm not sure if this is just a school rule, or because of Covid-19, but as far as I know, Covid-19 is not transmitted by touching stuff so I'm led to believe that what my principal is saying about us not being able to play due to Standard Operating Procedures is complete bullshit.

My school also has many great chess players, and my math teacher is pretty damn good, about 1800 for Classical irl. I had a game with him and he crushed me. Respect to him for outright breaking the rules and having a game with me. That was great.

Anyways, I want to know if this is a norm in other schools. Chess is such a great game that teaches us skills such as awareness, critical thinking skills, etc. and gives me and my friends a great topic for us to talk about. Any advice for how I can possibly persuade Prefects and Teachers to allow us to play chess during recess? That's be greatly appreciated.

Since the pandemic I rediscovered my love for chess, I played as a kid in the school team but then not really much for 25+ years. I recently joined my companies team and since then played a bit more. Now since Covid I am really trying harder to improve my chess and I have learned 3 openings to which I stick (English for white, Pirc against e4 with black and Dutch against any other white opening)

More often than not I am coming out of the opening with a decent advantage, I am also often finding the correct middle game plans and then my opponents either resign or I am entering the endgame stage and there losing terribly. Of course I lose games, mostly because of horrible blunders like not defending a mate in 1 or simply 'sacrificing' a piece for no compensation... but that's a diffrent story or maybe not? 

Just now I gave away a Rook + 6 Pawns versus Knight + 5 Pawns blundered into a draw and blundered this into a lost position.

I have no clue whether Giri was actually hacked or not.

Really, man? Also, did you read the kind of shit that was said in those tweets and DMs? Absolutely none of it matches Anish's personality/style of talking/biases. 

Also, there was a hacking attempt made for Levy's Twitter but he had 2FA enabled so he was spared. That's already damning good evidence that suggests an external hacker was present. And regarding PHN's tweet about the ""early jab"" where ""Anish"" reciprocated with the 17 year old comment, it's so stupidly obvious the hacker had done it. I don't know why the hacker chose to respond at all then, but that comment was instantly deleted. Why on earth would Anish knowingly respond with something that's so scalding? There is absolutely no motive behind it, even he understands the repercussions of something like that will be vile.

It's so effing dumb. How are people so stupid? Especially level headed people like Levon and MVL (who liked Levon's tweet that indirectly accused Giri of staging the hack). I'm going to guess they don't know the full scenario/context, but who knows.

People are complaining that Anish's post-hack tweets have not helped him get in the clear and makes him look dubious. Like?? Take a look at his Twitter, 99% of it is banter and sarcasm, if not shitposts. He's not going to give a heartfelt apology publicly, that's not his thing. He has apologized to the people to whom the DMs were sent (Nigel Short confirmed this for his case), and for all we know he's tried to calm things with everyone behind the scenes. Even Hikaru says it's obviously a hack, don't be dumbasses.

(Didn’t even mention the ban just said they wanted a fresh start because they’ve gotten better) I analyzed their games on their current account and they play on average 85-95% accuracy. They’re being smarter the third time around and mix their own moves in with the engine. (I’m like 800 elo and they make some moves that even I see as losing after playing the ‘best’ moves- which should tell you something). They are around 1500 rating. I’m curious what the average accuracy is for a 1500 rated player (I assume it would be around 70-80%?) The reason I know they are cheating is how I found out the previous times… when they stream their screen their mouse goes off screen for a few seconds then comes back on after EVERY move their opponents make (despite the fact that they were literally using the best moves 95-99% accuracy on the games of their old accounts). So general question and the reason I’m making this post… what is the average accuracy for a 1500 rated player on chess.com? I hate that I’m so curious about this, it’s just that I dislike the fact that a friend would cheat against me just to be ‘better’ at chess and brag that they’ve gotten so good.

I understand that imposter syndrome is something that gets thrown around a lot by people like me, who lack any psychological training whatsoever. 

BUT, today I found myself thanking an opponent for playing me. Not just ""thanks, these were fun games!"" It was more: ""I'm thankful that someone as highly rated as you would take the time to play me"".  

My opponent was about 2190. I was 2168. That's just 22 points difference. (bullet btw, if that matters.)

On one hand, you create an imbalance as soon as move 2, so one would expect that it is theory-heavy. On the other hand, I feel like exchanging an e pawn for a d pawn is not that big of an imbalance, and after the queen retreats, you are relatively free to develop as you want - so there might be no strict rules to follow.

1059,60,Leveling up in chess feels like black magic sometimes,"A couple years ago, my rating peaked in the 1400s.  I took a break from chess but kept up with puzzles, to the point where my [chess.com](https://chess.com) puzzle rating reached the 2600s.  Recently, I started playing actual games again and my rating plummeted, stabilizing around the 1200s.  My mindset was completely different having spent so much time on puzzles.  I was constantly looking for tactics, which wasted time when they didn't exist, and I often played too aggressively trying to force my way into tactics. 

It was super frustrating because I remember feeling how easy 1200 players used to be, and now I was going 50/50 against 1100s!

After taking some time to shake off the rust, I got back to the 1300s but hit a wall.  I knew I wasn't playing as well as I used to but I didn't know why.  Then, I watched some video which with an offhand comment about chess theory - tactics arise from good position.  

I told myself to stop making random attacking moves in the early/mid game, striking at a piece which could just retreat somewhere, and leaving me positionally worse off.  I said OK, let's just focus on making a good positional move all of the time.  Develop my pieces, get my rooks into open files, very simple stuff that I feel like I already knew.

However, all of a sudden, my rating started climbing again.  I broke my previous high within a week.  I'm at 1500+ now for the first time ever. 

My win % a couple years ago vs. 1500+ players was 16%.  In the last week it's been 42%. 

The crazy thing is, it doesn't feel like that simple lesson should have made that big a difference.  It's not like I'm not constantly recognizing moves which I would have made in the past but now I see are bad.  It really feels more like I drank a chess playing potion and now my brain just knows how to play chess better.

I don't know how else to explain it.  It feels like magic.  Does this resonate with anyone else?",0,53,9,0.3612,0.0,0.762,0.238

Given this starting position, if Magnus plays let’s say 10 games as white against Stockfish, do you think it’s possible that he actually draws one? Furthermore, if Magnus is given let’s say 1 month of prep time in this position do you think he might have a sliver of a chance of actually winning a game?

* **For middlegames**: Most of the 'practice' I do is just generic tactics since most tactics appear to be from middlegames and endgames. Maybe the same complaint applies here like filtering middlegame puzzles by ECO, but I'm not yet interested in studying middlegames even.
* **For endgames**: You can 'practice' for both [theoretical](https://chess-endgame-trainer.web.app/home) and [practical](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ouh61n/resources_on_practical_endgame_after_josh/) endgames, eg 'practice' like [rook endgame](https://lichess.org/training/rookEndgame). Why can't i 'practice' sicilian?
* **For openings**: I tried asking my cousin who was the 1 who re-introduced me to chess a decade ago (which was around a decade after my dad taught me to play). And e said 'that's the time you have to start consulting books' (or other online courses or whatever I guess).
   * So there's both '[study and practice](https://www.moviequotesandmore.com/doctor-strange-best-quotes/)' for middlegames, both '[study and practice](https://www.moviequotesandmore.com/doctor-strange-best-quotes/)' for endgames but only study for openings?

# Soooo...so far the best way i see to...

**get better at openings in a practice kinda way would be to play unrated games.**

* This particularly sucks for black even if you do [what HairyTough4489 describes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lichess/comments/rkjjqd/comment/hpajuth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) because you can't just expect someone to play e4 or d4 depending on your convenience. All the more you can't expect your opponent to play the 2nd move you'd like.
* So simply, what, you get better at openings in a practice way only by actual playing? Like
   * 'I feat not the player who has played 10000 openings once but the player who has played one opening 10000 times'
   * like 'I fear not the person who has practiced 10,000 kicks once but the person who has practiced one kick 10,000 times' ?

&amp;#x200B;

# What I got so far:

HairyTough4489 [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/qf7k5d/comment/hvpikj9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3):

&gt;You don't need to ""fear"" playing rated games with your opening repertoire.

my [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/qf7k5d/comment/hvpikj9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3): (emphasis added)

&gt;well not actually afraid or anything. **just like if rated games is the actual exam, then what's the 'practice' for specific openings**? I mean, I can 'practice' like [rook endgame](https://lichess.org/training/rookEndgame) \[edit: in r/lichess \]. why can't i 'practice' sicilian?

Whether it's moves or time, it sounds pretty [unethical](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/rxapdf/cheating_when_is_the_onus_on_a_federationa/) to me.

# Consequently, I cannot believe

'[Hikaru and GothamChess Tell You to MOVE (Time Management Extension)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/lowajn/i_created_hikaru_and_gothamchess_tell_you_to_move/)' is not cheating/unethical while using [scratch boards](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/rm6kxd/against_rules_etiquette/) is outright cheating.

Scratch boards do not have external assistance while this extension clearly is.

* A scratch board, say from chessvision or something (as long as engine is off) that you open in the middle of a rapid game (I don't do it though, but I don't object to anyone who does) is **just an externalisation of your thought process. It's still you.** It's like [arrows and stuff](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/26821/are-banter-blitz-players-who-draw-arrows-on-the-board-during-the-game-breaking-t), well at least in my opinion. I also think it's absurd that scratch boards are allowed in correspondence but not in live. But anyway...
* A time management extension **isn't an externalisation of anything**. Apart from getting one's one feel, there's no automatic timer in our heads that tells us we've been thinking too much for a certain move.
   * The closest I see this is an externalisation of is in that it's an expedient version of manually setting a timer right after our opponent makes a move. But in this case, we'd be preparing to press this button while simultaneously thinking of what our opponent's next move could be and what we might do next ([if you are](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/q9c7hv/why_isnt_there_an_option_not_replacement_for/)). But actually in either the case of a timer or an extension, you're still using a [machine](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/3_Idiots#:~:text=Define%20a%20machine.%E2%80%9D,saves%20time%2C%20is%20a%20machine).
   * A scratch board is no machine at all really since you could've used a physical board. The only machine part you might argue here is in the setup of the position, but you could've done just inputted every move on a physical board starting from move 1.

I've thought of few ways to justify the time management extension, but I don't see how they don't apply to scratch boards:

1. In the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/rxapdf/cheating_when_is_the_onus_on_a_federationa/) I talk about how there's no way to detect if someone is using a scratch board as opposed to say, a [keyboard extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/pc47cr/do_you_think_lichess_should_ban_people_who_use/) or an engine. Making this allowed balances the playing field. You could apply this to the time management extension too.
2. You could argue 'it's not giving me an unfair advantage because the other person can do it too.' (This is different from having a person physically beside me because my opponent cannot necessarily just get someone to spend 3-30 minutes of their life to watch me play a board game.)
3. It's like buying a better mouse than your opponent or something.

Conversely, I've thought of some arguments against scratch boards that I think would apply to time management extensions.

1. It's not a feature of the site. It's something external.
2. You can't use [scratch boards in real OTB ches](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/rm6kxd/comment/hpk9pmp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)s like what ilintar says
   1. 'it gives you an unfair advantage. Answer yourself the question: would it be allowed for you, during an OTB tournament, to set up a second board on the side where you would try out different variations? The answer is pretty similar in this case.'
      1. Arguably, time management extensions are worse if you make this OTB comparison because surely allowing players to bring machines to some OTB but non-FIDE tournament is a bigger rule to bend than just allowing players to have 2nd boards on their side (or letting players [write on their scoresheet or on a separate sheet](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/26821/are-banter-blitz-players-who-draw-arrows-on-the-board-during-the-game-breaking-t)).

**I really don't see any argument that applies to why the time management extension isn't cheating while scratch boards are cheating is except...**

# ...simply that r/Chesscom has arbitrarily decided that it's ok?

# So, what, is it really that ['what is ethical' is determined by 'what is allowed/cheating'](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/rxapdf/cheating_when_is_the_onus_on_a_federationa/) rather than vice-versa: 'what is allowed/cheating' is determined by 'what is ethical' ?

* Recall that [keyboard extensions](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/pc47cr/do_you_think_lichess_should_ban_people_who_use/) were previously considered 'ethical' (used in quotes because well lol they're indeed not ethical as confirmed in that they were later banned).
* Imagine what everyone would be saying about **arrow extensions** if r/chesscom or r/lichess didn't have arrows.
* Btw, so what happens if someone **makes an extension to show elapsed time** (something I'd arguably like more actually) like in the meltwater champions chess tour but r/lichess or r/chesscom happens to say no? What's the difference?
* What if r/chesscom or r/lichess suddenly makes some absurd rule like **'no headsets; only earphones/speakers' or '**[**no optical mice**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MouseReview/comments/j5f08s/is_it_possible_ive_been_pressing_my_mouse_so_hard/)**'** ?

# To clarify:

1. I don't (necessarily) think the time management extension is unethical. But I think the extension is unethical if scratch boards are unethical. I think what would be best is if the extension were a(n optional) feature of the site. After all, you can certainly use this extension in correspondence. Same with elapsed time and scratch boards (in live).
2. Again, a difference between the extension and keyboard extensions is that there's no way to detect time management extensions (except with some intrusive anti-cheat in which case people would just user timers in their phones). My principle is what you can't detect you must accept (I refer to nonliving things. You can't test for external help from humans, but of course it's still unethical). We aim to detect engines, sandbagging and keyboard extensions. We cannot detect scratch boards, time management extensions, headsets or mice.",0,133,25,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

1143,44,Theories on Giri Saga,"There are couple of theories I have seen floating around and I would like to summarize them all. But before that, let's look at the timeline of the events:


A) PHN tweets an absurd statistics on draws
B) AG gets into ""friendly"" banter with him
C) AG makes an outrageously lewd remark about PHN  (17). This tweet gets deleted within seconds.
D) Hours later and early morning in AG's local time (assuming he was in Netherlands then), there is a barrage of absurd tweets from AG's account. They were a combination of funny (yet explicit) comments on genitalia, accusation on preparation theft in private DM, etc.
E) AG gets back, deletes all the tweets, and tweets ""Hacked.""

THEORY 1: 
In order to save his face after tweeting (and subsequently deleting) artifact C, AG ""staged"" the hacking. He deliberately waited until it was late, editing and modifying some DMs. This thinking would have culminated as a result that he was extremely worried after he tweeted C in rage and needed something more dramatic to overshadow C.

But there were couple of loopholes in this theory that don't quite make sense, or rather hypothesis that need explanations
i) what transpired in the time between tweeting C and first tweet by the ""hacker""
ii) During the time when ""hacker"" was in action, he/she liked couple of tweets. AG doesn't quite do that. Even if he had done so to throw the us off - when the clean up process started, he forgot to ""unlike"" the liked tweets for a long time. If it were AG himself, he probably would have never forgotten to ""unlike"" as part of the cleaning processing.
iii) The ""hacker"" shared the contact numbers of two professional players, including a player who is underaged. AG would have never done that. He was a big risk to do that.

THEORY 2:
The hacker got access to his account around the time when C was tweeted, and it was done by hacker and was quickly deleted. In order to have maximum impact, the hacker waited and chose the time when the likelihood of AG being away from devices would be very high. And then utilizing that time in between to Photoshop the images. 

THEORY 3:
AG did tweet C and later deleted it. In order to dig in more, hackers tried to get access to his account and succeeded. They then made random tweets while reading DMs. In the process, they started sharing some of the DMs too. As claimed by AG, some of these screenshots were photoshopped too.
Some questions that need explanation:
I) Why did the hackers photoshop only some of the screenshots? The screenshots were scandalous by itself. What did the hackers achieve photoshopping them? Or, are they even photoshopped? Did AG lie about some of the screenshots being photoshopped, in order to downplay the whole thing? 
Ii) What if none of the images were photoshopped?


Anyway, there are some of the questions which needs to be answered in order to find the truth:
* did AG actually tweet (and later deleted) the tweet to PHN on 17 thing?
* did AG receive popup/email  notification on phone for unrecognized login? 
* What does the 'login location'  show? Does it capture geo tags from different devices that were used to login to the account?",0,21,4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

a) A player has to be still active and rated above 2700 as of today (Nakamura has been moved to inactive for a couple of months now and Dominguez was inactive in 2017 because of his transition to the US, but I still included them because why not, it's not like they became any worse)

b) I counted years and months from the moment they got to 2700 and held it uninterrupted. If they dropped below even for a month, the counter is reset (dropping in the live ratings for a moment doesn't count, only the monthly rating lists).

1180,81,Farming / rating 'manipulation': what exactly is the difference between situations of Ukrainian GM Iuri Shkuro (and FM Ihor Kobylianskyi) and Czech cheater GM Igors Rausis (PRE-CHEATING)?,"# TL;DR What exactly was going on with each of them, and what specifically was the difference in their situations?

# Part 1 of 2: What I've read

# 0 - recent question:

[If Carlsen wants 2900 rating in classic so much, why wouldn't he play against &lt;2000 rated players and win every game?](https://www.reddit.com/r/chessbeginners/comments/sq0651/if_carlsen_wants_2900_rating_in_classic_so_much/)

* CratylusG says [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/slx87s/comment/hvtas3v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3): 'FIDE has a 400 point cap in difference when calculating rating changes.'

# 1 - GM Iuri Shkuro (and FM Ihor Kobylianskyi)

vivkaa [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/pq7qa8/comment/hdda5ep/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) introduced me to the idea of '[farming](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ixrf2p/how_the_elo_rating_system_works_and_why_farming/)' saying

&gt;Shkuro and another Ukrainian GM were farming Blitz rating points against very low rated players(which is why their classical is not very high), barely anyone in the Ukrainian Chess scene knew them. FIDE blocked their rating as a counter measure

Apparently, it's related to these: [chessbase](https://en.chessbase.com/post/dark-times-for-ukrainian-chess), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ewndcx/dark_times_for_ukrainian_chess/), [FIDE](https://www.fide.com/news/344) and [stackexchange](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/39039/iuri-shkuro-is-part-of-the-top-peak-fide-blitz-rating-list-2800-apparently-by). The other 'GM' appears to be FM Ihor Kobylianskyi.

# 2 - Igors Rausis (PRE-CHEATING)

See 'act 1' [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/jb5x55/chess_igors_rausis_a_threeact_drama_mathematics/) by deleted user in r/hobbydrama

&gt;Rausis' trick was eventually noticed (...) the governing body (FIDE) could do nothing as Rausis was breaking no rules.

There's also [this](https://www.ecforum.org.uk/viewtopic.php?t=10300) where someone named 'Chris Rice' says Rausis could pass Carlsen:

&gt;(...) Rausis has been hacking the system. Basically playing players rated way below (...) for calculation purposes, however low their grade is, its counted as only 400 points below him. (...) in theory he could pass Carlsen at some point.

(Damn. Rausis could've been a [system beating](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s4wrxi/how_did_you_beat_the_system/?sort=new) legend (or [anti](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antifragile/)\-legend like famous vs infamous). But then e just had to cheat.)

# 3 - based on the reddit discussion in (1), it appears (1) and (2) are the same

CratylusG (again): [the players mentioned seem to be exploiting the 400 point rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ewndcx/comment/fg374cw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

# 4 - Claude Bloodgood

I understand [God Bongcloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bloodgood)'s case is different from either of the above cases: Claude Bloodgood was (allegedly) colluding, which like sandbagging is definitely rating manipulation.

# Part 2 of 2: My 1 question

It seems like Shkuro and Kobylianskyi were blocked or punished or something while Rausis wasn't (again pre-cheating). **What exactly was going on with each of them, and what specifically was the difference in their situations?**

1181,82,How many points in the Grand Prix would you need to qualify for candidates?,"*TLDR: You likely have to win a leg or be a double-finalist to qualify for candidates*

Ahead of the final, I was curious as to what the minimum number of points were to qualify for the candidates, so I broke down all the possible results in the table below. Uninterestingly, it was possible to conjure up scenarios for everyone (except a double winner) to not qualify, and for qualification to be possible with just 1 win (all 3 winners have to finish bottom of group as a start).

Based on the table below, the turning point seems to be 17 points, but there's a catch - due to tie-breaks, winning a leg and finishing 3rd in group in the other leg is much stronger than finishing finalist + semi-finalist.

In my experience at around the 1800 level in [chess.com](https://chess.com) blitz the person will usually capture my pawn first before castling, but on occasion if they don't I'll capture it and then they'll recapture and then typically move their bishop back to e2 to break the pin on their knight to their queen as my bishop is typically developed to g4.

So, is this a 'big' concession by white if this happens or not really?",0,89,18,0.4404,0.0,0.854,0.146
1227,28,"""Keep it simple: 1. e4"" not actually simple at all?","I bought this book ""keep it simple: 1. e4"" because as a lifelong e4 player I've been looking for an opening guide which I could reference and which would give solid recommendations against less common lines where I sometimes feel unsure (for example in the french defense). I found this book to be extremely confusing and unintuitive. Im just under 1900 on lichess (probably around 1600 USCF) so I think Im in the range of who this book is geared toward, but I did NOT find it simple at all. I ended up returning it and buying Starting Out: 1.e4 instead which I find to be better in every way.

The first thing that bothered me was that he recommends the two knights caro kann when there is absolutely no reason to avoid the exchange variation. In many of the lines white ends up totally cramped for space and while it may be objectively fine, its not a line I would ever willingly play into. The author often says stuff like ""and white continues with great play..."" when I have absolutely no fucking idea how to continue in that situation. The exchange caro is just much more intuitive and probably gives white a better advantage. Even the advance seems easier to understand than a lot of the two knights lines. Furthermore, I didn't understand was why he recommends the exchange French. He recommends the most cramped/closed positions possible in the caro kann but for some reason wants to avoid the mainline french for something which doesn't really give white any tangible advantage at all and has no clear plan. I can understand opting for the tarrasch because it gives black less options than Nc3 but there's just no legitimate reason to play the exchange, especially in the context of this book.

The next most upsetting thing was that he recommends the Moscow variation of the sicilian. Why would I even play 1.e5 if I wanted to go into the Moscow variation of the sicilian. It just makes no sense to trade off my light square bishop and give black nearly instant equality. He also recommends the c3 sicilian against e6 which means there's a completely different variation I have to study, only to get absolutely no advantage out of the opening once again. I really see no reason to avoid the open Sicilian when it's exactly the type of game I hope for when I play 1.e4. I get an open game where i can develop all my pieces to great squares and then go for the attack. It's theoretical but most of the weight of theory falls on black and the play for white is quite intuitive, especially for an e4 player. This book is basically e4 for players who don't like to play e4 which puts it in a very weird category.

Lastly, I cant understand why anyone would recommend the 4 knights instead of the regular move order for the scotch. All that does is force black to NOT choose inferior sidelines which give me a better game and are exactly what I hope for when I play the scotch opening.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting Out: 1.e4 is what I will probably use for the rest of my career

The repertoire they give is based around:

the mainline scotch against e5

the open sicilian

the tarrasch french

the exchange caro

the mainline pirc/scandi

I find these to all be simple enough and give white great attacking chances",0,51,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

2. I try to play riskier and get an advantage, but end up losing to some kind of tactic because I wasn't play cautiously enough.

This is part of a bigger problem with my chess ability: I'm constantly in dominate opening positions, but the way my Opponent has set up means I end up trading down to an endgame quickly anyway

Hello [r/chess](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/), I am practicing the Traxler countergambit although it is busted with 5. Bxf7+. Regardless, most people play 5. Nxf7, which is drawn with best play.

The continuation goes: 5. ...Bxf2+ 6. Kf1 Qe7 7. Nxh8 d5 8. exd5 Nd4. After black plays Nd4 (r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/5n2/3Pp3/2Bn4/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R w q - 1 9), the evaluation is ""+0.4"" at depth 50 if you enable cloud analysis on Lichess, suggesting a draw, with the following engine line: 9. d6 cxd6 10. Kxf2 Bg4 11. Qe1 Nxc2 12. Qf1 Nxa1 13. h3 Be6. ([https://imgur.com/a/8JtpGsg](https://imgur.com/a/8JtpGsg))

I have so many questions about this evaluation. After 9. d6, the theoretically drawing line is 9. ...Qxd6 10. Nf7 Qe7. Why does Stockfish recommend 9. ...cxd6 instead? What happens if the game continues: 9. d6 cxd6 10. Kxf2 Bg4 11. Qf1 instead? Stockfish evaluates this at +3 at lower depths but according to the previous analysis, at depth 50 it showed +0.4.

1319,20,How best to use and read a chess book?,"Hey everyone. I’ve recently returned to chess, and have climbed to 830 blitz from 530 beginning October. I’ve been enjoying playing and improving by learning theory and practicing tactics, and i’ve just received a chess book for my birthday; the first for me.

Herein lies my problem; i’ve opened up the book yesterday and spent about 75 minutes reading around 20 pages because i’m trying to visualise all the moves that are listed on the book for the games provided, and trying to solve the puzzle exercises (which for some reason I couldn’t find a solution for them on the book).

After i’ve tired my brain out just playing out these moves in my head, I realised i’ve just spent all this time doing nothing but practically visualisation exercises.  I feel bad just skipping ahead to the pages that don’t have the bulk of their pages as moves and different variations, and so I just ended up putting the book down.

I wanted to ask if anyone here that’s more familiar with chess books would know how best to tackle reading them, and help me better understand how to digest them. Are they intended to be visualised cover to cover? How should how handle the exercises and puzzles in the book.

This is to be said because of how well they both played, similar to matches between engines lasting 100 moves or more because their play is so accurate. (they could have shorter games against each other im just not aware of, i’m not claiming an engine miniature is impossible).

First I started showing her how all the pieces move, then did Q+K endgame, P+K endgame, multipawn + K endgame, R+K endgame. Next I went over basic tactics. Next we did midgames of like 1-4 pawns and a few other pieces (minor + R, 2 minors, 3 minors, etc). About 3 weeks ago we started doing full games.

She actually has decent sense I think. She can usually tell what are strong squares for minors and what pawn formations look good vs weak. Her biggest problem right now after 3 weeks of full games (I don't know if this is just her or if all beginners struggle with this) is just that she'll hang pieces left and right. About 3 times a game. Either she'll not see a piece being outright attacked without protection or she'll move her piece into a hanging square. So this is where it's stalling right now, and it doesn't even make sense to start talking about 2 or 3 move sequences yet. Of course I always point those out and let her take the moves back but she's getting frustated and thinking she's not getting better becaues she doesn't see these obvious hangs.

In the regional tournaments he seems to place around 10-20 out of 50 so he needs to improve. He'd really like to medal in a regional tournament and needs to get there in order to go to the National competition.

I have no interest in/time to learn chess myself (sorry), and he has now learned enough in his local chess club to beat me regularly when he doesn't lock in on playing a particular pattern and leave something wide open. His problem is that the chess club/playing with friends at school is his main method of learning, but all the kids there stay at roughly the same level as each other. He'd like to kick on a bit faster.

Can someone recommend some books for kids his age/skill? Or websites? Youtube courses? Or should he just keep doing puzzles/playing randoms on chess.com/lichess? I feel like a tiny bit of added instruction might help him get to the next level. He speaks/reads English so that's not an issue. As a non-chess player I'm at a bit of a loss.

1426,27,Alekhine's Defense = questionable?," One-time SuperGM Nigel Short doesn't like Alekhine's Defense.  


""I do not rate this defence very highly at all..."" (*Nigel Short's Chess Skills*; p.10)  


Short then goes on to list Alekhine's Defense in the section entitled ""Black openings: Bad and indifferent"".  


Short explains later in the book that he doesn't like the opening as Black because it allows White ""...a free advantage in space.""  


As an example he cites his match against GM Lev Alburt (US vs UK Challenge, 1985). Short beat Alburt's Alekhine every time he tried it (3-0) (Short won the overall match 7-1).  


Senior IM Jon Edwards also seems not to think too much of it (*Teach Yourself Visually: Chess*; p.122). Edwards apparently never played it once between 1968-2006.  


According to the Mega 2009 Database (ChessBase), of 53,604 Alekhine Defense games:  


 \- Black scores above average (48%).  


 \- White wins: 20358 (=38%), Draws: 14998 (=28%), Black wins: 18236 (=34%)  


That looks quite reasonable for Black.  


In the same database, Short has played 8 games with the Alekhine, drawing with Kasparov, Polgar and Adams, plus drawing two other games. In the remaining 3 games, he won 1 and lost 2. Overall, Short scored 3.5/8.  


In the same database, Bobby Fischer has played 7 games with the Alekhine, drawing 4 and winning 3 (one of the wins and one of the draws were against Spassky!). Fischer thus scored 5/7.  


So in the right hands, it looks like the Alekhine is quite a useful defense. Alekhine himself certainly seemed to think so. He played it 16 times between 1921 and 1933, scoring 10.5/16 (including wins against Bogoljubow, Maroczy, and Mieses, plus draws against Sämisch, Nimzowitsch (2), Aurbach, Znosko-Borovsky and Yates).  


Does anyone else agree with the views of Short (and Edwards) or is it just a matter of personal bias by Short because he has not had much success with this defense?

Played badly  today  and only managed to score 3 1/2 out of 6 points.


My first thought about OTB as a person who played mostly online. -

- Tactics are harder to spot. I blundered twice by giving away my piece for free as i could not see the opponents pieces when its too far away ( totally didnt see the opponent piece bc im so used to see a 2d screen on the small screen(

- Players can be so annoying/act smug.

 There was one time a dude kinda slam the piece when he captured the piece that i blundered. Also  there was a kid that i fought who  was kinda slamming the clock when hes losing.


- the extra rules such as touch move , illegal move etc

- time scrabble is so freaking hectic unlike online chess. For example the opponent could accidentally trip ur pieces and then press their clock and. You would have to spend ur time putting it back while ur time is running.

- more intimidating than online chess.



To conclude i kinda dislike otb chess due to

- time scramble can be so messy

1438,39,Does Anyone Know What Happens To People Who Got Caught Cheating in USCF Rated Tournaments?,"I recently was playing the under section of a major tournament. In the second round of the event I was paired with one of the top seeds. The game was close, however I felt really off about my opponents play since he went to the bathroom a lot, often on his turn, and he went for every critical move of the game. He made it look even more suspicious by playing the move instantly when he got back. I had informed one of the arbiters about my suspicion during the game. They initially told me that there is no rule against going to the bathroom in USCF tournaments. As the game went on, my position started getting worse and I got annoyed with all his trips. I even told him to play his move before going to the bathroom once out of frustration and he just shrugged back at me telling me that he drank too much water. The arbiter I informed started hovering around the board and that's probably when he stopped using those bathroom trips. In the end, he was struggling to convert a rook endgame two pawns up, but eventually found some breakthrough. After I lost, I went to check in my room with an engine. Up until the endgame he was playing all the top engine moves. I just couldn't believe someone was cheating in an OTB event.

I alerted the TDs and organizers about my game before Rd 3 and they mentioned that they will keep an eye on him. They made an announcement about the electronic device policy before the round started and then kept a note of when he was going to bathroom and the moves he played when he came back. After 20 minutes, I see my prev rd. opponent walking into the playing hall to collect his bag and being escorted out. His opponent was told that she will be receiving a full point because he was caught cheating. I felt somewhat vindicated. The arbiters told me that I would only get a half point bye since there was no ""sufficient evidence"" in my game (even though I was the one who informed them). I argued but couldn't get them to change their decision. 

There was no announcement to the other players in the section about the the incident. His first round opponent and I were personally informed about the half point bye and him being kicked out of the tournament. I'm appalled that such incidents are shoved under the rug. After everything that happened, I'm still unaware of what the punishment was for getting caught cheating in US chess. Would he get a temporary ban from USCF? His US Chess profile doesn't have any message showing he is banned from events. Doesn't that mean he can play still play tournaments? Knowing that he cheated being close to 1900, I'm worried that such people can reach master level without any action being taken.",0,90,15,-0.5574,0.205,0.795,0.0

1447,48,Chess Openings,"So the large majority of people I come into contact with say you don't need to study theory or openings until you are at the National Master level. I see this everywhere in the chess community. Now i'm going to hate and say that these are usually people who chess ratings haven't improved in over a year. But the reason why I throw shade is once I tell them that studying openings boosted me from being rated 1000 to 1500 in 30 minute rapid games in six months' time they accuse me of cheating. They generally refuse to believe it. It continues to fascinate why people insist something that they admit they have never tried doesn't work. The chessable courses i'm grinding through are key to my improvement in my eyes.

1448,49,How to deal with unsportsmanlike player at chess club?,"Theres a very unsportsmanlike player at our club who constantly taunts and belittles everyone else. Whenver you make a mistake he yells out ""blunder!"" or ""inaccuracy!"" ... ""better move was..."" and then says the engine move or what he *thinks* the engine move is. He also says what he thinks the engine +- is. He plays the kings gambit as much as he can and knows like 30 moves deep into every variation. If you respond something other than e5 to 1.e4 he just laughs and calls you a patzer.

He's also OBSESSED with Hikaru Nakamura. He talks about him all the time and shows everyone a picture of him with Hikaru (Its really blurry so its hard to tell if its even him). He's constantly talking about him as if he's a close friend even though he only (maybe?) met him one time. Its bordering on creepy and makes everyone uncomfortable. He calls him ""Hikaru-San"" which I think is part of his obsession with Japanese culture. He also brings japanese noodles/Ramen to the club every day and will spend like 5-10 minute eating them during his turn just to taunt you. Meanwhile he will be mumbling words in japanese.

We tried approaching about his conduct but he just did some weird anime villain laugh, yelled something in Japanese, then ran off to challenge another person to a blitz match. We obviously don't want to tell him not to come but it feels like his presence is deterring new people from joining and its also exhuasting.",0,54,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I’ve seen some posts here saying things like “Help, I lost X points” or “What’s the fastest way to get to 1500 from X?”(Not sure how recent the latter is, but I remember something along those lines.) These kinds of posts are sort of missing the point when it comes to an Elo rating.


Think of how a rating works: If you are consistently playing like a 1000, your rating will eventually reach, and stay at 1000. Similarly if you are consistently playing like Magnus Carlsen it will not quite reach 2900 and just kind of hang out in the high 2800s. 


That said, if you play a bunch of games while in bad shape, you will play those games below the rating which you usually play at, and your rating will go down. For those who really are worried about their rating, my suggestion is to choose a consistent time to play a couple of games every day, and to play a couple of games only. 2-3 rapid games is better than 15 blitz games. If this sounds like standard “getting better at chess” advice, it is. If you play better consistently your rating will follow.


So how do you get to 1500? The answer is by playing like a 1600. If you are having trouble as a 1400 and want your rating to go up, stop, take a deep breath, remember that you are 1400 because you make just as many mistakes as other people rated 1400, then aim to improve as a player.


For the reader: your rating goals, within reason, are probably achievable. You do not need to reach that rating tomorrow, or a year from now because the rating itself is just a number. Your goal should be to improve as a player until you can consistently play at the rating you want. You can do this! Good luck, and enjoy yourself.",0,55,9,-0.3818,0.271,0.729,0.0

Richards mentions that he talked to a professional player friend of his who claimed to search for such chess savants in preparation for tournament play. How realistic is this? Are there enough chess savants for this notion to become renowned within the chess community? Are there enough to spend time searching for in whichever city a tournament is held?

Gata Kamsky, by comparison, has a really well-written article/bio on Wikipedia and on chessgames(dotcom) but I feel that too much weight/emphasis has been unfairly placed on Hikaru as an entertainer/streamer rather than a man who dedicated most of his childhood and young adult life to becoming an extraordinarily remarkable chess player.

Hikaru's peak rating is over 2800 whereas Gata Kamsky's peak rating was 50 points lower. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that a part of me feels like being a ""twitch streamer"" (which are a dime a dozen) tarnishes the achievement of becoming a super-GM.

Any help would be appreciated!",0,32,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
1515,16,Ruy Lopez game analysis,"Hi all:

This is my first time posting here. I'm around 1650 [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) rapid. (username is [Platon\_Karataev](https://www.chess.com/member/platon_karataev) if anyone wants to challenge me ;)) Wanted to share a 30 minute game I just played on the black side of a Ruy Lopez. I've done some analysis, but would love to hear thoughts on how I can improve my game, things I may be missing, or motifs particular to the Ruy. I won this game, but I tend to struggle a bit with the black pieces in this opening.

\[pgn\]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 d6 7. c3 h6 8. Re1 Be7

9. h3 O-O 10. d4 exd4 11. cxd4 d5 {from my pov this was the first big decision. I anticipated e5 as my opponents response, closing the position, then Ne5. If he threatened the knight with bc2 I was probably going to retreat Ng5} 12. e5 Ne4 13. Nc3 Bb4 {computer says this is a blunder due to a forcing sequence: Nxe4 bxe1-- not the best move but what I had planned-- qxe1 dxe4 qxe4 bd7 bxh6!! with a very strong attack. I did not see the bxh6 idea, but it is in harmony with the strong kingside attack backed up by the bishops that was a theme of the game.} 14. Re3 {we both missed the computer's suggestion} Bxc3 15. bxc3

Na5 16. Nd2 Nxd2 17. Qxd2 Nc4 18. Bxc4 bxc4 19. Rg3 Kh7 {a huge blunder. Computer wants Qh4 with equality. I thought after Rxg7+ kxg7 qxh6 kg8 bg5 f6 he either had to accept a repetition with qg6-qh6 or allow me chances with bxf6 qd7 protecting the 7th rank, but it turns out he can win this with accurate play} 20. Rxg7+ Kxg7 21. Qxh6+

Kg8 22. Bg5 f6 23. Qg6+ Kh8 24. Qh6+ Kg8 25. exf6 Qd7 26. Qg6+ Kh8 27. Qh5+ {the blunder. Apparently Qh6+ was winning, but this allows me to defend} Qh7

28. Qf3 Be6 29. Re1 Rae8 30. Qg3 Bf5 {huge blunder. At this point, I thought I had fended off the attack and was winning. I missed that he had Re7} 31. Re5 {he also missed this} Be6 32. Qe3 Bf7 {around here he offered me a draw, which I declined} 33. g4 Qd3 34. h4

Qd1+ 35. Kh2 Qxg4 36. f3 Qh5 37. Kh3 Qg6 38. f4 Rxe5 39. dxe5 Re8 40. Kg4

\[/pgn\]

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of blunders here. I think one area for improvement would be anticipating my opponent's attacks (bxh6, the follow up to the rook sacrifice on g7, and re7 later on). I try to play the same openings (London system as white, e5 against e4, d5 against d4), but it might be good for me to get a better sense of a plan as black in the Ruy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love any feedback or insight from the community.

1516,17,Getting back into the game and want a good board and weighted pieces,"Learned to play in the 5th grade and was a member of my Middle School and Highschool's Chess Club. Back then I had a rolled-up vinyl board and plastic pieces I was given by my Chess Coach at the time. I wish I still had that set but it's long gone and I cant seem to find a store that has this kind of sets in person... so now I'm here asking the Reddit Community.  


I'll never forget playing with a really heavy and weighted set as a kid in a tournament (I thought it was so awesome). So i def would prefer a heavier set with a quality board i can roll up and store in a bag. Any recommendations? I've looked on Amazon and there is just so many options its overwhelming trying to understand which is better and which is overpriced.

1525,26,I beat a Chess coach!,"One of my friends has a Chess coach. I mostly stay at home and don't go outside much so he asked if I wanted to come to his house for a lesson with his coach, one lesson would be free. So I was like sure why not. I play Chess all the time on the phone so it would be cool to play in person. 

The first big problem I faced was playing on a real board which I'm not used to. Me and my friend played a couple games before the coach came. I would guess he's at 700 Chess.com level. He doesn't even like Chess. His parents got him a coach because he too doesn't go outside much and this could be an activity for him.

Then the trainer came. He was a late middle aged man. We played a game first so that he could assess my level. And what do you know, I won! Easily! But I don't think that win actually counts because he deliberately played bad. He played 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 as black. But other moves were normal.

Then we played 3 more games. I lost the second game (I'm White) missing a tactic and losing a piece. The third game (I'm White) I was down 2 pawns but I had a huge attack with my 2 Rooks and 1 Knight on his King and he got checkmated. The last game (I'm Black) the game came down to Queen and 3 pawns each. He had f, g, h and I had e, f, g pawns. It's a draw but I knew I would lose because I suck at endgames. After few checks he managed to trade the quees. Still it's 3 vs 3 but my endgame is so bad that I lost it. I have never won or drawn a King and pawn endgame (except the really easy ones where I'm up pawns and he has none). 

So the score was 2-2. Or 2-1 if you don't count the first game (though f6 is the only bad move he deliberately played). It feels nice to beat a player who were supposed to train me.

I asked him his rating he said he's a B level player. I don't know what that means but didn't ask any further. I'm 1700 Bullet on Lichess. My Blitz and Classical was 1750s Lichess but I haven't played those for over 2 months. These days I only play Bullet chess (30-50 games a day).

1561,62,Fun Chess for the amateur hobbyist player,"I play chess a lot. I’m very weak. My rating on lichess is usually around 1500 or so these days but it fluctuates a bit. I’m improving rapidly though. My lichess rating was in the 700s this time last year.

This game is my zen. As somebody who grew up doing things like sport and classical music in psychotic high level pressure cooker environments and eventually burning out, I find it refreshing to be into something as complex and rich as chess without the pressure of having to be really good at it. I know I’m never going to be a grandmaster so I am able to relax and just have a bit of fun.

My hobbyist mentality towards chess is reflected in the way I try to play. While I never *try* to play moves that are literally just objectively bad (happens all the time anyway), and I *do* always try to win, I often times try to choose the weird option because I want my games to be entertaining little stories I can enjoy looking back on more than anything.

Chess players of Reddit! What are some tips you have for the player who wants his games to be as interesting, cerebral, rich, aesthetically cool and adrenaline heavy as possible? What openings have you found lead to the craziest games? What middlegame strategies are the most fun to play? What kind of endgames (if any) should I be aiming to reach? 

There are a few openings I try to play. With the white pieces I almost exclusively go for stuff in the d4 repertoire—blackmar diemer is a favorite and queens gambit type positions where my kingside bishop is in a fianchetto are my usual go to. For the black pieces I like the d6 repertoire, Indian stuff, and I’ve learned how to passably do the taimanov Sicilian from my friend who plays over the board and taught me. Sometimes I just freestyle the opening too though and see how many pawns I can sacrifice to throw my opponent off. I don’t have amazing success with this approach because I am an idiot but when I do win this way it’s the most satisfying thing in the world. 

In the middle game I just basically think about going for the king. I like to aim as much stuff at the king as I can and then find a way to clear the pawns out the way and stuff. I am usually too scared to sacrifice but I do know that you can sacrifice a bishop in the advanced French defense (I get those positions from cowards who don’t take my pawn in blackmar diemer sometimes) with the white pieces if black castles kingside.

But yeah is there anything else I should be doing to specifically make my games as cool and memorable as possible? Ways to make sure my games are full of insane tactics to discover? Any players to study? I am still a noob so forgive me if this is a stupid question. Thanks!!!",0,41,7,0.5106,0.0,0.645,0.355

On the first Friday of February, Berlin will play host to the first leg of the [FIDE Grand Prix Series 2022](https://i.imgur.com/oMHdfn1.png), organized by World Chess. From 4-17 Feb, sixteen elite chess players, including grandmasters Pentala Harikrishna, Andrey Esipenko, and Radosław Wojtaszek (replacing Wei Yi, Liren Ding and Dmitry Andreikin) will compete for the chance to win the last two spots in the Candidates Tournament to be held later this year. They will also fight for a prize fund of €150,000. 

The drawing of lots ceremony determined the pools for the first leg of the Series. The ceremony, held over Zoom, was chaired by the Chief Arbiter Ivan Syrovy and CEO of World Chess Ilya Merenzon, and attended by the Grand Prix participants. Before the drawing, the players were divided into four baskets according to January standard rating. The Chief Arbiter allocated the players to four different groups via a randomized selection procedure. The group stage promises exciting games, with the pairings to be determined at the opening ceremony.

Ilya Merenzon, CEO of World Chess says: “We are pleased to bring the Grand Prix to a purpose-designed venue in Berlin. Our friends in Berlin and all over the world will finally have a stunning chess club that is in line with chess’s rising profile. The world probably needs a chess hotspot as the Café de la Régence in Paris and the Café Central in Vienna once were, but with more people and a remarkable menu!”.

I (26m) have been playing online for around 10 years. I’ve never played OTB other than casually with some friends. I want to start playing some OTB but have some questions.

1) I live in the US. Do I need to be a member of USCF to have a rating? How about to play in tournaments? Are there legit non-USCF tournaments?  

2) I play on chesscom with a rating around 1500. I have no idea what that would translate to USCF. What kind of rating groupings do they usually have?

3) Do all tournaments cost money? I’d love to pay but I’m in grad school with limited time/money. I dont wanna keep throwing some away every time I play. How much do they cost?

4) on the topic of cost. Do I NEED to bring a set, clock, and notation sheet?

5) What’s the best way to find tournaments and clubs? My goodness the USCF website sucks so hard

1577,78,How many lines do you learn in OTB chess?,"I'm wondering how in depth opening preparation is for OTB chess at the intermediate level?

I'm making my own opening repertoire at the moment with the help of Stockfish and master databases (I know, not the best way to improve but I enjoy doing this so it's a fun way to study for me and I am actually learning the common ideas). For example, the main thing I've finished at the moment is the french as white, where I've got around 90 lines total after 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3, with around 25 in each of the Rubinstein and Steinitz, 35 in the Winawer and a handful of sidelines. Is this normal, too many, not enough?

I know the number of lines I need depends on how forcing/sharp openings are, hence why I have more lines in the Winawer, whereas a lot of my Rubinstein prep simply focuses on punishing common mistakes (which are abundant even in slow time controls on lichess).

For reference I'm 2000 on everything from bullet to classical on lichess at the moment, and I'm considering starting otb tournaments after I graduate in summer (idk what the translates to as FIDE) and the main thing I want is to play people who are better than me in the middlegames, as I think this is the best way to improve from games.",0,41,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I feel like my chess ability isn't as dictated by how out of shape, chesswise i am. I could not play for months and still perform roughly the same. But with tactics the sharpness is gone just like that
 

I stare at a problem for 15 minutes that i know i would have gotten right had i not stopped doing puzzles and i can't solve it.

Regardless of me getting worse there is something soul crushing when you look at a problem and no matter how much time you spend on it you just can't solve it.

Me and a friend have been working lately on a chess project, ChessIFind, and we would like to know your opinion and possible ideas to add from people on this sub. 

Our goal is to make a platform to allow players to find people to play chess. Something like a ""dating"" (but **not** intended to be used/considered as one) platform where one can find people by place (such as a cafe), time and (chess) capabilities (Elo for people who into chess, and a diferent system for new players), and just have to meet there to play.

Given that we found many people who really like to play on board, rather than just online, and the covid is getting more managable, we think this is an interesting concept, mostly for people who just want some fun, and want more than a chess club experience.

Since move 12 or so, where they were down a queen for two pieces, with an eval hovering around +8.0 depending on the depth, they somehow started playing with incredibly accuracy, with every move posing me a problem despite my overwhelming advantage. Then, once they finally turned it around into a winning position, they offered a draw.

It was already suspicious how they suddenly started playing so well from such a bad position, but then to offer a draw once you're finally winning makes no sense, because if you earned that win yourself you would never give it up.

I messaged them in chat, screenshot of the chat log: [https://ibb.co/cyWsR7y](https://ibb.co/cyWsR7y) (warning: NSFW language from the alleged cheater) and they openly admitted to receiving external assistance to steal the draw.

1663,64,"Chess.com, Lichess.org, USFC, and FIDE all use different rating systems. This can be confusing, so I'm attempting to explain the differences.","I just wanted to put this information out there, because it becomes frustrating that not all the systems are the same, and sometimes in conversations here, and in other online portals, miscommunications happen ABOUND because one person will be talking about their 1700 lichess rating being a beginner, and the 1500 rated chess.com player is thinking they're insane and that 1300 is beginner, crossing over to intermediate, and a disagreement ensues, but they're talking about the same strength of player (roughly).

First off, FIDE is the only organization that uses the Elo system to rank players. It's also not the only sport that uses Elo, and Elo is not specific to chess, but that's a whole other conversation.

Here are the systems that the different organizations use:

#Chess.com

 Glicko 1 system. Of the two online portals, this is closer to FIDE's rating system (Elo). Much closer. As chess.com explains it, it's basically just Elo with an added calculation for how you play in an attempt to be more accurate in predictions. 

Another difference chess.com has is, despite the Glicko 1 system recommending players start at 1500, chess.com has adapted this and you can pretty much choose your own rating based on how strong of a player you feel you are. The glicko 1 system will take care of the rest as you win or lose over time.

The average rating on chess.com Rapid is roughly 900. This chess.com Rapid rating, is typically +~200 higher than USFC, and +~100 higher than FIDE. (These are VERY rough estimates pulled from what seems to be the closest to average ratings. These differ as you go higher in ratings). 

(editors note: I'm not very confident in this number. I've seen forum posts about it but I can't confirm it with any official source. If anyone has that, i'd love the addition).

You can read more about the system from chess.com [Here](https://support.chess.com/article/210-how-do-ratings-work-on-chess-com)

#Lichess.org 

Lichess uses a similar, but more recent version of the system chess.com uses, called the Glicko 2 system. In practice they're very similar with Glicko 2 adding a system for volatility, hopefully making it more accurate for predictions. 

The difference with Lichess is that they took the recommendation from the Glicko system to start every player at 1500. As much, Lichess's rating system is the most inflated of all the systems and as such, the furthest away from FIDE's rating system. In practice (by looking at comparison sheets), Lichess' Glicko 2 system seems to place players roughly 300 points above their chess.com rating, which is roughly within 50-100 points of FIDE. As the ratings go up, these tend to level off, with players around the super GM level being the same rating on lichess as they are on chess.com.

The average rating of players on Lichess is roughly 1500. Lichess compared to others is +~300 higher than USFC and +~400 higher than FIDE. 

(editors note: I'm not very confident in this number. Again, with the chess.com number, I can't find an official source on this, it's based on the only information I can find on lichess forums and on reddit). 

Lichess has a handy fact sheet for the different systems broken down that you can read about [Here](https://lichess.org/page/rating-systems).

The next two won't be as in depth, as there isn't as much to explain.

#USFC

Uses a modified Elo system. It's the closest to actual Elo of all the systems from what I can see. You have to go into the maths on this to see the difference between Elo and USFC, but they're pretty close, usually within 100 points of each other, most of the time a lot less (like &lt;50). 

#FIDE

Uses Elo. 

Hopefully this can clear up some confusing differences when people mention different rating systems.

#More than anything, I hope this highlights the importance of specifying which rating system you're referring to when mentioning ratings outside of context. 

Please not, I am not an authority AT ALL about this, and this is just information i've collected from the internet. If you have any corrections, please let me know so I can edit it in to provide the best information possible.

This is really interesting because the initiating attacker is loosing tempo with no gain other than an enemy Pawn or piece now where things ended off. I can think of other themes or laws of Chess. What are your thoughts of an opponent who puts his forces on the white squares as white? What is your best response to this broad scenario? What if you put a few pieces like a queen and bishop on the dark squares perhaps a Pawn as well and work with the queen to decimate control of light squares of white?

I’m looking for some pawn endgame help. In this endgame I had a feeling I had a slight advantage. I knew he had a bad pawn formation on the King side.

1721,23,Stalling / quitting games is a massive issue that isn’t discussed enough.,"So I think we’ve all had games where you’re clearly in a winning position and the opponent refuses to resign, forcing you to wait out the remainder of the clock. This is already extremely annoying in Blitz but in ten minute Rapid games or longer it is agonisingly slow. Having to wait out a game simply because the opposing player is salty and refuses to press the resignation button sucks. I primarily play chess to alleviate boredom, but having to deal with these kinds of games on a regular basis forces me to return to said boredom until the match is over.  
 

In the past few months, I have had countless games where I’ve achieved a clearly winning position early in the match only for the opponent to just stall and wait out their time for as long as possible.  
 What convinced me to write this post is that I just had three Blitz games in a row where all three players stalled it out after I achieved a winning position in the opening or midgame.   
 

Although I receive messages from Chess.com regularly that they have “taken action” on those I have reported for stalling, I have kept tabs on some of the particularly egregious players who I reported and they are ALL still active. I guess it’s possible that they received a warning and have refrained from stalling going forwards, but the sheer amount of players who I encounter stalling their games suggests that Chess.com might not be doing all they can to deal with this issue.    
 

I just really wanted to get this sentiment off my chess and ask if the community at large has also experienced this issue to the same extent I have? It honestly is starting to ruin my experience with online Chess and its been far more of an issue for me than cheating has. At least with cheating it can (usually) be identified quickly and Chess.com will issue bans fairly rapidly.",0,73,12,-0.2023,0.167,0.833,0.0

1724,26,I am the first author of Stockfish. Ask me anything.,"I am Tord Romstad, the first author of the Stockfish chess engine.

Let me get one thing out of the way first: The word ""first"" in the above paragraph does not mean that I'm the most important contributor to the project, but only that I was the one who originally wrote the program that eventually became Stockfish, although it wasn't yet called Stockfish at the time.

I first became interested in computer chess as a teenager around 1990. I started doing my first clumsy chess programming experiments a few years later. After many aborted projects, and many multi-year breaks when I didn't think about computer chess at all, I started working on Glaurung 2 (named after a dragon from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien), the earliest ancestor of Stockfish, during Christmas 2006. The first public version was announced in [this post](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13597) on the Talkchess forum in May 2007. Don't try to click the download link in that post, it leads to a website that has been dead since ages. 

In 2008, during one of my periodic breaks from computer chess, Marco Costalba became tired of waiting for new developments and started working on a fork of the project, which he named ""Stockfish"". The name was chosen because [stockfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish) is produced in large quantities in my home country, Norway, and one of the biggest importers of Norwegian stockfish is the Veneto region in Italy, where Marco lives. I find it amusing that when googling for ""stockfish"" today, all the top hits are about computer chess.

For a while, Marco and I kept working on our separate branches of the projects, while communicating and stealing ideas and code from each other. After some time, we decided this was not a very efficient way to work, and decided to join our efforts instead. Because Stockfish was a little bit more advanced at the time, we decided to keep that branch and let Glaurung die.

We were soon joined by Joona Kiiski, and a bit later by Gary Linscott. Since then, the project has exploded. By now we have close to 200 people who have contributed code to the project, and an army of testers who have donated CPU time to help test our changes. [The steady stream of improvements in playing strength is astonishing](https://nextchessmove.com/dev-builds).

Back when I started, I was confident that with enough effort, I could make something of strength comparable to the top commercial programs of the time. I would not in my wildest dreams have imagined that others would help develop it hundreds of rating points beyond that. 

I'll start answering questions around 4 PM UTC, a little more than one hour from now. In the mean time, feel free to start asking.

I'm currently 1650 elo ([chess.com](https://chess.com), I don't have a FIDE rating) and have just played a wide variety of different openings without really learning any specific ones well (mostly because people always just played random moves when I was lower rated, and it was only around 1500 rating that I started seeing book openings more consistently).

1744,46,Out of the blue challenges,"I was hanging out on lichess today when I received a challenge
from a player I have never played before, nor even chatted with
etc.  What's more, this player was rated nearly 400 pts higher
than me.

I accepted the challenge (it seemed only polite) but it got
me to thinking: how and why had I been picked to be challenged
by an unknown player?

In my mind, the principal ways of getting matches are: 1) submit
a match request in the open pool, 2) join an arena, or 3) pick
a match from the lobby.  I thought challenges normally happened
between players who are following each other, and are each other's ""regulars"",
so to speak.

how do you pick who to challenge?

&amp;#x200B;

The concept is to have openings which:

\- Are decent, but not good enough to be played with much frequency by GMs in classical, and are less commonly seen at all levels.

\- Ideally, create messy, double-edged, attacking games.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of current ideas:

As white, e4 e5: Ponziani (don't know much about it, but I read somewhere it's underrated). Or King's Gambit.

Against Sicilian: Grand Prix Attack (saw Leinier Domínguez get flagged as black in Banter Blitz. in my experience not easy to defend against.)

However, it seems that the Traditional line of the QGD includes Bg5, which of course takes it away from the queenside to pin the knight on f6.  Doesn't this introduce weaknesses on White's queenside, especially if you close the return square by playing e3?  What does pinning the knight actually do? Even with the pin, it seems far too difficult to play e4, and I never see the f6 knight actually being taken as far as I've seen.  So what's the objective there?",0,42,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

1780,82,Confusion regarding optimal study plan,"I‘m currently on the 4th repetition cycle on ""1001 Chess Exercises for Beginners“ and I intend to do a 5th one as well, but figuring out what to do after that is a bit of a struggle. This book has been my first serious, focused, daily effort to work on my chess (before that it‘s been all Youtube videos, some sporadic online puzzles here and there and occasionally going over master games on chessgames.com) and unsurprisingly, it improved my chess a ton – especially compared to the random bs I had been doing before.

Naturally, I‘d like to keep up this type of dedicated study after the current project is finished, but I‘m unsure whether it would be smarter to continue along the tactics route (1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players would be the obvious suggestion) or shift focus to other areas of the game, such as strategy or endgames, both of which I‘ve never studied seriously before.

The other day, I was listening to a Perpetual Chess Episode starring legendary adult improver Neal Bruce, who famously spent four years on tactics and tactics only before switching to the realm of strategy books, which he intends to study for three whole years. Do you think that is smarter than, for instance, working through one book on tactics, then one on strategy, then one on endgames, then one game collection etc.?

Instinctively I‘m leaning towards the latter approach, but I would hate to spend my precious study time in an inefficient manner. Also, I‘m worried about losing my newly acquired tactical prowess if I spend the next months only working on strategy. Or should I rather go for an all-in-one-approach, like the Yusupov series?

Sorry for the long rambling, but what do you guys think? How do (or did) you train the different aspects of chess? Do you just do tactics everyday in order to stay sharp, even when your main focus is a strategy book or course?

Really any input is greatly appreciated. Should it matter, my rating is 2000s blitz/2100s rapid on lichess.

This lazy implementation was uniquely bad for the site and made the Chessable version mostly pointless. 

Chessable have seemingly agreed with the users of the site regarding the uniquely terrible state of the course, since staff have repeatedly promised that an update of the course was to be made ""soon"". This has gone on for years. Until yesterday!

The update finally arrived, the course is finally avaliable in the form it ought to have been in from the beginning. Everyone is finally happy, right? 

Not so much, for instead of updating the old version of the course, as was expected by existing customers, they have choosen to release it again as an entirely new item. Do owners of the old, broken version of the course recieve a copy? NO. Instead old customers are very generously offered to buy the new version at a discount, thus making us pay twice in order to recieve what all of us expected to get from the start and have multiple times been promised.

In this game I'm playing white against a buddy of mine.

It feels like magic when it happens in the game, and analyzing this one I'm not sure how to approach fixing the issue.

Move 13: At this point my midgame plan is to start an attack on the kingside now that I've castled queenside.  So that's exactly what I do.

Move 14: The f4 pawn is now an issue, with three attackers and two defenders.  My thought here is that by taking the knight, I remove one of his attackers on f4 and if he takes with the pawn his queen will be stuck defending it for a while.  If he takes with the queen, I bring my bishop to e4 and I'm happy there, too. 

Move 15: I want to get my queen out of the pin now, but still defend the f4 square if he takes with the pawn.

Move 16: Continuation of my idea, and take with the bishop.

I liked it alot, so i decided to try it out, and downloaded the play magnus app. Ive never really tried chess, but i do know how the pieces move. I like puzzle games, so i always arrogantly thought id be good at chess. Well my ego was shattered. I was able to beat the app at max 7 years old. 7 1/2 i couldnt beat. I got a few long matches, but the app won every time. Then i got frustrated after losing 3-4 times and deleted the app… Im a 19-year old guy. I know this is a pointless post, but tell honestly, am i decent at chess? Am i losing because i dont like stragegies or because im talentless or somewhere in between?

My question is, if the elo rating system thinks I'm 1818, why am I losing against 1600 rated players? And if I'm losing against 1600 rated players, why doesn't the elo algorithm assign me the correct elo of 1500 - 1550 or something? 

Essentially what I'm wondering is why is the elo algorithm so slow to update your elo rating? -7 points for losing against someone 200 elo lower than you seems VERY slow. Shouldn't it be more like -50 points?

I am looking for one that maximizes winning chances, is practical, and is also good for improvement. I am about 1550 rapid on [chess.com](https://chess.com) Here are my thoughts on some of the major responses to e4:

1. e5 - Too many openings / traps too know. However, it is the most solid.
2. French - Cramped position and weak light square bishop makes it not so appealing.
3. Caro-kann - Slightly more appealing than the french because of the improvement on the lightsquare bishop. I haven't played it much but I am worried it is too ""solid"" and would thus hinder my improvement.
4. Najdorf - Most optimal but the theory would require too much maintenance and studying. However, it is the opening I play now and I am comfortable with it. I am also worried in the future of keeping track of all of white's potential sacrifices and responses.
5. Taimanov- A good opening but I find it hard to understand scheveningen pawn structures.
6. Sveshnikov- Comes with dynamic play but I don't like the structural weaknesses.
7. Classical - Good but I would prefer not to play against the Richter-Rauzer regularly as I heard black walks on a thinner line than in the Bg5 najdorf.

Any advice would be appreciated! Feel free to include any opening not on my list and I will include my thoughts.",0,39,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

He asked me to teach him a bit of chess as well which I was happy to do because I love teaching chess to new players.

We played a game the other day and he’s definitely more of a defensive player which makes sense because it seems to me that Shogi is a much more defensive game.

My personal play style is much more aggressive because I really enjoy playing attacking chess (This is why I like the Stafford Gambit so much). The problem is that most of my openings are aggressive because of my play style and I’m trying to think of something more defensive to teach my friend. I told him that I would teach him the London system because that’s the first real opening I ever learned and it’s also the most defensive opening that I play.

1816,19,Has chess ever been a game for you ?,"This morning I listened to a scientific podcast of Hubermanlab in which the subject was play and neuroplasticity. 

At some point he described what makes a game a game. He describes play and what makes us focused and playfully engaged in a game and one point in particular got me thinking about chess. 

**The stakes have to be low**
For a game to be fun, the stakes has to be low. If it's too high, too much adrenaline is being involved and it kills the fun and lightness of an activity. 

I feel like the chess community is filled with ""highly"" competitive people (which I also am) and the higher the stakes, the more exciting the game. Tip : A little bit of trash talk here and there helps doing that. 

The thing is excitement =/= fun. I don't even remember having fun when playing chess. The best chess memory I have is one OTB game I had with a friend who seemed to be focused as much as I was in the game, which might be normal stuff for OTB players but I'm a chesscom player. 

When I play online I'm the salty type : spam rematch button when I lose in order to ""beat that loser ten times in a row"" but starts a new game when I win, I feel like the stakes I'm putting on the table are too high and it brings nothing but frustration. 

By the way I'm working on this and I say gg to everyone and I stop asking for rematch whatever the result is.

My brief background story - I'm in my 30s and in the past year I came back to chess (played a lot as a little  kid including 1 tournament but then stopped). Currently, 1300 blitz on Lichess and slowly improving.

Also, I have what is called  [Retinitis-pigmentosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa), which is a genetic disorder of the eyes causing slow  degenerative loss of sight.

So, I started thinking about practicing blindfold chess. I have an excellent memory (currently finishing my PhD in statistics and cs) but still all the tips and explanation I saw so far are ""be really good at standard chess, and it will come"" which, well I'm trying but not sure if I can reach such level (after all not everyone can be a pro as a hobby).

1935,38,Why is bad sportsmanship so unbelievably common in online chess?,"I like to play 30 min games but it's getting annoying at this point because I can't even win a game without my opponent either letting the clock run out for the remaining 20 mins (and sometimes making a move at the last second) or just taking 10 mins for each next move until the clock runs out. It happens increasingly less frequently as my rating goes up. It was absurd how frequently it happened when I was around 1200 elo, but it is still happening 20-25% of the time at \~1600 elo. 1/5th - 1/4th of players (probably more than that since its even worse at lower elos) acting like poorly-raised toddlers over a game is just mind-blowing to me. That's not even accounting for how people act in chat or the people that spam draw offers when losing, but I can just ignore that.

The thing is, I don't even understand the mindset behind it at all. It's like they are mad at me because they made a bad move and are losing. Do they expect me to just let them win or something? I don't understand what kind of injustice they think I have committed against them to warrant anger.

It also seems like this is a problem specific to chess. I have played all kinds of online games, many of them competitive, and there are always a few people with bad sportsmanship in any of them, but I have not seen any other game where it is with this frequency or this severity. Like there are always people who rage in chat in any game or who will rage-quit when losing. If people simply rage-quit and actually abandoned the games in chess I wouldn't even care that much, but no, they have to go out of their way to try to waste as much of your time as possible to try to get back at you because they are mad that you attempted to win the game or something.",0,64,10,-0.5423,0.28,0.72,0.0

Deepl translation of the abstract:

The most enigmatic story in Russian chess sport, which is practically unknown outside it: someone has been sending chess players, including minors, envelopes for years; they contain used condoms and clippings from porn magazines. Victims of the actions of the ""chess maniac"" (as they themselves call him) have turned to the police, but to no avail. There were plenty of theories as to who he was, but none of them could be convincingly confirmed. Nevertheless, Meduza's special correspondents Kristina Safonova and Liliya Yapparova were able to find this man - and give his name in this article.

There are no words in his letters. Strictly speaking, there are no letters themselves.

The envelope usually contains a page from a pornographic magazine with one or more pictures. Judging by the models' hairstyles, the sender prefers the style of the 1980s. Less common are more modern photos: for example, a picture of two naked blondes from the Latvian magazine Eroticon, published in February 2003.

The sender folds the page in half and puts a condom inside; the condom contains semen. He uses white envelopes; if the envelope has a see-through window, he prudently covers it with a paper patch. He puts a postage stamp on it, with an image of blue wildflowers, red poppies, a bright flyswatter, a badger in the grass, or a space satellite. Then he writes the addressee's address - in jagged, slightly childish handwriting - and drops the letter into a mailbox in Riga.

The recipients of the letters are girls or young women, mostly from Russia. All of them necessarily play chess professionally. The letters come to them, too, ostensibly from chess players and chesswomen. ""It's more like a cry from the soul. But I don't know what he's screaming about when he sends pictures,"" says chess player Alina Bivol, who received 15 such envelopes. - They are absolutely faceless letters, identical. They don't say anything, they just change the name of the supposed sender and that's it. I don't know what this person wants.",0,138,23,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I follow up so its again under attack, feeling very smug and yelling how its all over now.

Causing frustration 

Here we can see mind games played at the grandmaster level. Nepo takes back the ceremonial first move only to play the same move, a trick magnus pulled the day before.

The first trick is employed before the game starts, you likely already know the your first move as white but your opponent doesn't so let them wait a while. This can possibly cause frustration from the start.

Making your opponent wait and letting them sweat is a useful tactic and can be used to an even greater effect if they blunder a piece and is likely to lead to a resignation if it's a queen. If you see your opponent blunder their queen (or any other piece) wait 15-30 seconds, allow them to see the blunder and sit waiting hoping that you haven't. Also allow another 15-30 seconds after you take the piece on your next move for further frustration. 

Crushing moral

When playing gambits or tricks you want to premove to make it look like a blunder and then if they take you will wait, this is to make your opponent think that you don't know what you're doing and are having to think. This can lead to overconfidence and if the play pays off their moral will be crushed.

When given an opportunity to take en pessant you must take it 100% of the time even if it isn't a good move, you must display your superior knowledge of the game. This is again to crush moral. 

Last but not least the bongcloud, magnus himself has talked about the psychological effect of the bongcloud. It's brazen and can be moral crushing if you manage to take the lead.",0,51,9,0.34,0.279,0.41,0.311

So yeah, anxiety wins, I think. Keep in mind, that I had only 30 nine-streak games and further lesser, so it is not statistically proven data. Also, I am a slightly win-ending guy (423 win ending streak and 351 loose endings)

And finally pattern map. Every time I win, I go right, when I lose, I go left. Numbers show how many times I was here.

1998,1,Anthony Edwards slump- my personal observations,"Overall, this slump doesn’t worry me much. He’s a pure scorer and is 20 years old, I would be more surprised if he didn’t have stretches like this.  What does stand out to me is that this stretch is really the first time I’ve seen his confidence in his ability this low. He’s been passing up on some looks that he usually takes, mainly catch and shoot 3’s on the wing and just opts to swing the ball. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, I believe it’s led to some points but I still think he should try those ones when he gets the chance, he seems like a guy who needs to shoot himself out of a slump more than anything. He’s looked very hesitant all around the last couple weeks, not every game Ofc, but a lot of them.

I do like what I’ve seen passing wise. I’ve always said he has good passing touch but currently lacks the mental capabilities to be a good playmaker,  but recently he’s been making good reads in the pick and roll, something that he did maybe once a game before this slump. They’re not doing it a ton but he’s looked pretty solid at this recently. Definitely a silver lining in this slump.

A small criticism I have is he really has no mid range game. This obviously isn’t essential and he doesn’t need to become demar or anything but just a comfy little floater from around the ft line would be huge for him. Would help get him back in a rhythm  and just score more in general, also puts his body in less danger when he drives. I don’t mean to compare him to lamelo, but this is smth he does very well, it really opens up the pick and roll for him. maxey is another young guy who does a good job with this.

I do think he will break out of this sooner rather than later, he’s a good player.

Also, this is unrelated to the slump, why does he never have anything run for him off ball? Very weird utilisation of him, often see him just standing in the corner.",1,47,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

2009,12,Do you believe that Shaq is underrated in terms of all-time rankings?,"I know it might seem crazy to call an all-time legend underrated, but I truly believe it is the case for Shaquille O’Neal, who I believe is a top 5 player in NBA history.

At his peak during the Lakers three-peat from 2000-2002, Shaq was arguably greater than any player in NBA history. This was especially evident in his (should have been) unanimous MVP season in the year 2000, averaging 30/14/4/1/3 on 57.8 TS% (+5.5 TS% relative to league average) during the regular season &amp; 31/15/3/1/2 on 55.6 TS% (+3.9 TS% relative to league average). I have never seen NBA players more demoralized than those who had to guard Shaq at his peak.

While a lot of people act like all of Shaq’s greatness came from 2000-2002, his years in Orlando are nothing to scoff at, and I find them incredibly underrated. This is especially true when talking about the 1995 NBA Finals. Many people claim that Hakeem throughly outplayed Shaq in that series, but Shaq still averaged 28/12.5/6/0.3/2.5 on 61 TS% (compared to Hakeem’s 33/11.5/5.5/2/2 on 51.4 TS%).

With all of this in mind, I personally think that the only players definitively above Shaq in all-time rankings are Jordan, LeBron &amp; Kareem. I personally have Shaq either 4th or 5th (alongside Bill Russell), which I know is a relatively high ranking for him.",1,69,12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Like, never in the last 20 years? But still the Knicks and the Knicks fans think everybody is trying to get to the Knicks. I’m not saying (Zion) won’t end up there — there’s all kinds of ways people can end up somewhere — but this idea that everybody wants to be a New York Knick. I mean if that were the case then they wouldn’t be as bad as they’ve been for the last 20 years.”

I'm a Sixers fan obviously so I'm super fucking big on Maxey. Both of his immediate improvement going into next season and his peak.. So stastically what do you think Maxey will average in '22 - '23 and also how do you expect him to develop or maybe you have a comparison on what kind of player you think he will be like.


I literally watch Maxey and I see his ceiling as a modern AI-LITE.

The LITE is vital here so before everyone kills me.. lol

     If AI played today in the modern NBA, I would expect him to be more efficient, make more threes, less qpg and spg, and NOT as much of a volume scorer though I can see him slide into the top 15 in ppg.

     I believe Maxey is well on this route of becoming a modern AI-LITE.  next season he will average 23/4/4. Looking at AI and his per-36 stats, AI put up the SAME stats pretty much. Maxey this season is putting up 17/4/5 in roughly 36mpg. He never gets tired. His endurance, fire off balanced mid range, and his body control to finish with contact on layups remind me a lot of AI in general. 

     I don't care how much no one believes me, I literally GUESSED that Stateline for Maxey for next season and THEN I saw AI put up the same per 36 minutes going into his 3rd year. Good guess by me! 😄 


     Okay if Maxey can put up 23ppg going into his third year, what about his peak? I honestly think Maxey WILL put up around 28/5/7 for a good four seasons of his peak. He'll be about a 6 time all star. 2 time all-NBA. Will be at least top 3 for the scoring title one season.

     So I think having Harden on the team right now is the final key for him. All he's lacking is the necessity to be more aggressive on offense. I get it from his POV. He probably doesn't want the team to think he's a ballhog and take away from Joel. But now that Harden is here, I think he will give him the mentorship he needs JUST from the right guy ❤

We all had hope after the first two games because it appeared that Fox had finally found his big men; we thought we finally had the duo to end the drought. But after the last three games with fantastic performances from both Fox and Sabonis the losses will continue to pile up due to the lack of performance from their teammates. It really makes you wonder what the Kings were doing especially because this was supposed to be a “win now” scenario trade.

But then the Nebraska player was upset and pushed the Iowa player. Got called for a dead-ball technical foul. Iowa shot 4 FTs and made all of them. Nebraska is now down 11 and ... commits another intentional foul, with 27 seconds to go. At this point it just seems unsportsmanlike, but idk, maybe if the dude misses one and then you make a 3 some crazy shit can happen.

Iowa goes 1-for-2, Nebraska takes a couple seconds to score a 2, then Iowa has no problem inbounding the ball and getting it across midcourt to dribbl ... wait no. Nebraska takes **yet another** foul, this time down 10 points with 17 seconds to go.

2149,52,[NBC Sports Philadelphia] Joel Embiid after the win: “That was probably the most wide open I’ve ever been in my career.”,"This is a clear shot at his former teammate Ben Simmons here lol. Watching the game, it shows how Harden commands so much gravity on the perimeter which makes the game easier for Embiid inside. These two are an almost perfect match. A playmaking shot creating guard and a dominant 2-way big man. Morey’s dream has become a reality. This duo is scary, and the east better watch out…

Pg: Gary Payton

SG: Kobe

SF: Rick Fox

PF: Karl Malone

C: Shaq

Coming off the bench (best 3): Derek Fisher, Bryon Russell and Horace Grant

21/22 Lakers:

SF: Lebron

PF: AD

C: Dwight

Coming off the bench (Best 3): Deandre Jordan, Avery Bradley and Trevor Ariza

2179,82,The NBA has just refused to talk about any international matter,"To start this off, I just wanna say that this is not meant to be anti-NBA or anti-player. Or some liberal/conservative BS. 

Ever since the whole china situation a few years back, the NBA and its players have just refused to talk about any international situations, even when it's clear who is in the wrong. My problem is not that the NBA players are not talking, it's the hypocrisy that it has shown where the players and sports media pick and choose what to be vocal about. Im not saying NBA players need to be the biggest voices, Im not looking for NBA players to decide what is right or wrong. I havent noticed them even use MLKs ""injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere"" quote anymore. I also understand that there are alot of issues in this world, but this Ukraine one has been pretty big. 

I know that money makes the world go round, and if I were in that situation I would probably do the same thing. Im not going to act holier than though. 

With this whole Ukraine situation, from what I know the NBA has little to no business affilitions with Russia and they are bombing Ukraine and yet only from what I've seen only 2 players have come out to say something (if there has been more let me know). The 2 players that came out are the only 2 players from Ukraine who are in the NBA. Im not saying NBA players need to make a huge statement or boycott games, but noone has even come out to be like ""I dont know what's going on there but all I know is please no more war"".  Or even print shirts that say ""no more war"" or something to that degree. My one question is, if this were happening in an african country (Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, etc) would they have stayed quiet?",1,63,11,-0.2732,0.179,0.732,0.089

2249,52,What am I missing with Booker?,"To make things clear, I think Booker tends to get overrated.

I saw a post earlier where someone was surprised that people thought Ja could be 1st team all NBA over Book (and others) and decided to genuinely try to see what makes people rate him so highly.

I used to think it’s was just based on this narrative of him being ‘cold’, ‘clutch’ and the Kobe comps. Ironically, the same type of who would have sworn he’s “the next Kobe💯” just a few weeks ago, said they lost all respect for him after that Raptors mascot thing, which I find hysterical (not relevant, just funny to me)

This opinion really started building for me when after last seasons playoffs I saw many people saying things like “well now that he had a playoff run, he’s definitely better than Donovan now”. To me they are two young guards who put up very similar numbers, on similar efficiencies etc. but Donovan has a history of consistently elevating in the playoffs, so I didn’t understand why to people that was it. No more debate. Ratio + Booker better🤡

Also just want to say I really like Book. I don’t like when people have a problem with the narrative surrounding a player which usually is cultivated by media and fans, and take it out on the actual player. He’s a great and fun player, and seems like a cool person too.",1,30,6,-0.296,0.355,0.645,0.0

2287,90,How would GS be viewed right now if they drafted Lamelo,"I get so disappointed when I think what could have been for the warriors. Imagine a long lanky lamelo bell running point while BOTH stephy and klay ran off ball marathons. It gives me chills thinking about how Kerr could utilize two of the best off ball players playing off the ball at the same damn time. 

Like holy fuck Imagine Steph and klay setting screens for each other, crossing each other baseline switching sides of the court. Wait wait wait. Hear me out.

Imagine a high pick and roll between lamelo and dray, with Stephen and klay stretching the floor on each side just posted in the corner ready for a catch and shoot. OR a catch in the corner, lamelo sets a screen on ball in the corner, dray sets a screen off ball in the corner, weak side wide open shot drifting to the top of the key. OR you can play 2 man pnr/pnp on both sides of the court with 4 strong ball handlers. Obviously this is a super basic version of what this could look like, but I feel like it's the equivalent of lining Josh Allen up in shotgun with 5 wide and letting him read through the progressions. And I'd for whatever reason nothing is there he's still the best player on the field and can say fuck da play and run for 40 yards.

I'm sorry but I think the actual basketball would be off the charts. The dubs would be unstoppable offensively. Like imagine running a system similar to what Quin Snyder does in Utah, or how the hawks super spread the floor with high PNRs for trey. Obviously the dubs have a great system now but man if they drafted lamelo and trotted out 3 guards plus dray. They wouldn't even be undersized cuz lamelo is fucking huge and would add length on the perimeter. 

Idk fam I'm high af so sorry for the ramblings. I'm sure j could have made what I'm trynna say more clearly. Like fuck I almost want to go buy a white board and draw up the offense I am envisioning and just post a breakdown on here instead of verbally trying to explain it.

2331,34,[OC] The Rookie Who's Weakness Was Basketball is Already One of the Best Passers in the NBA,"In the weeks before the draft, scouting reports came out about each of the draft prospects likely to be picked early in the draft. One graphic describing Josh Giddey listed his weaknesses as (takes deep breath): Ball Handling, Shot Creation, Assertiveness, Outside Shooting, On-Ball Defense, and Athleticism. A meme began to circulate describing his weakness as “basketball.” Considering that graphic and the public’s general lack of knowledge about him, he was often seen as a bit of a reach. Just partway through his first season, it is pretty clear that he was not one. 

Josh Giddey became the youngest player to get a triple-double in the NBA on February 12th in a game against the Chicago Bulls. On February 14th, Giddey and the Thunder faced off against the New York Knicks. In that game, GIddey showed off all the skills that make him special and had a career game. Against the Knicks, Giddey recorded 28 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists. He also helped his squad get a four-point overtime win. He will not be putting numbers like that consistently anytime soon, but it's an indication of just how high he can climb.

The appeal of Josh Giddey starts and ends with his passing ability. He does not have the flair of someone like Lamelo Ball, but his creativity, vision, and accuracy already make him one of the most dangerous passers in the league. Giddey is most effective when he can spray long-range passes all around the court. He can do it from the top of the key, off the dribble, in pick and roll situations, or in transition. Occasionally he is a little overaggressive with his passes, and his 3.2 turnovers per game is a result of that, but as he develops his decision-making will only continue to improve. For now, we can enjoy the many passes he does connect on. Giddey is a balanced passer, but he truly shines most with a few specific skills and passes. The first is his ability to attract the defense to him in the lane and kick it out to the corners. If you do not stay glued to your man, he will punish you for it. Against almost anyone else, it would be stupid not to help a little off a shooter on the opposite side of the court. If you do that against Giddey, he will respond with something like this:

*Processing video 1jt3b9qzn2k81...*

Those passes are technically difficult, but his technical ability isn't what makes him special. Giddey plays basketball like an elite quarterback, looking off his defenders before firing off the pass. He looks straight at the rim until the moment he delivers the ball. It is not something unique to him, but he legitimately is one of the best in the world at that particular pass. If those passes were not somehow enough to prove that to you, here is about 1 minute of Giddey picking defenses apart with that same genre of pass: (You are very welcome):

*Processing video x0kcc8n2o2k81...*

So when Josh Giddey gets into the lane, your top concern should probably be sticking to the shooters around the perimeter, right? Wrong. Giddey is even more effective at finding cutters, usually with incredible bounce passes that cut through groups of defenders and lead cutters and rollers straight to the basket. He loves to dare big men to come up and help against him, and if they do, he goes right to that bounce pass. He can throw a long-ranged bounce pass with the best of them, but his specialty is short, heavily angled bounce passes. By using such a sharp angle, he can get the ball to players that appear to be covered. For longer passes, he generally goes to the traditional chest pass or a quick baseball pass if he needs the extra velocity, but he breaks out his patented bounce pass occasionally in those situations as well. His toolbag is very deep, and if you have option covered he will beat you with another. Here are his best passes to cutters against the Knicks.

*Processing video c5js65ndo2k81...*

More than any other role, playmakers need a unique flair and unique style. If you haven't caught onto it yet, Giddey thrives by moving slowly until the moment he decides to speed things up. He loves to lull you in by moving slowly and methodically moving around the circle. But once he sees an open window for a pass, defenders should hope they don't have to blink. If they do, they might open their eyes to see the Thunder have scored. Giddey always plays with that attitude, but it is most obvious on his passes to rollers and cutters. From baseball passes across the court or close quarters bounce passes, here are some more of Giddey’s best passes into the paint:

*Processing video 54lgj32oo2k81...*

Giddey is far from a complete player. He occasionally has issues with his defense, his shooting is inconsistent, and his lack of athleticism may put a ceiling on his volume scoring abilities. But his weakness damn sure isn't basketball. In fact, at this point, it’s clearly his strength.

Will it translate to the playoffs?,"Derozan is putting up an FU season to all the analytical talk of how the mid range shot isn’t practical anymore in the modern NBA. He’s hitting shots open and contested and showing that there’s ways to score AND win besides layups and 3s (should be noted that he’s finishing at an elite level around the rim and drawing 8 FTA per game). 

This year, 57% of all of his shots have been 2 point jump shots (30% mid range and 27% long 2s). He’s hitting an unbelievable 55% of his mid range shots and 47% of his long 2s. To put this in perspective, Kobe’s best season in the mid range he shot 52% and on long 2s he shot 44% (Kobe shot 43% in the mid range for his career and 40% on long 2s). 

Putting this in perspective to derozans career, he averages 45% in the mid range and 40% on long 2s. Absolutely elite in its own right. The playoffs are were things get murkier for him. He’s a career 36% mid range shooter and 38% long 2 shooter in the playoffs. He’s shooting nearly 20% higher than his career playoff average in the mid range and 10% higher than his long 2 average.

Is Derozan playing to a level where only regression can be expected once the playoffs hit? On the flip side, if this streak continues into the playoffs, can he be considered the best mid range shooter of all time?

2400,3,Ime Udoka - The Consideration for COY,"When this season started the Celtics were putting on display a lot of exactly who they were last season. The core 4 from last season had returned in the starting lineup and a rookie head coach hadn't yet put his stamp on the team.  Tatum and Brown were still playing selfishly.  Smart had not yet found his role as a starter. The team was giving up bad leads and playing to the level up their competition and losing close games.

But Ime kept hammering his message of ball movement and pushing the pace to the players to the media publically on occasion.  Tatum and Brown started to pass the ball more.  Smart's shot selection became a lot better and he developed into a better play maker right before our eyes this season.  Rob Williams developed into a legitimate DPOY candidate who can also play point center from the elbow. And the Celtics started to play better.   In the half court set they started to whip the ball around with purpose and cut with purpose.  They started to move in unison on defense.  They turned their defense into fast breaks.  And their defense is, simply put, very very good. The Celtics hold opponents to 42.9%, 1st in the league and are among the top in blocks and steals and deflections. 

What Ime has put together on both ends has turned into nothing less than complete devastation of the opponent for the month of February where the Celtics hold a net rating of +18.8, plenty good for 1st int he league and the next closest team in the east are the Heat at +8.4.

For Ime, it was about unlocking the potential of 4 extremely talented players who were unable to find any success last season.  And he certainly has unlocked something alright.  

Tatum, Brown, Smart, RWIII had a net rating of +0.1 Per game last season.  This season it's +8.2.  This is a huge difference that comes down directly to Ime's schemes and player development/growth under his guidance.  This combined with giving minutes to players who really earn it vs the Brad Stevens approach of ""everyone gets a turn"" has really helped this team turn the corner mid season.

Should Ime be COY? It's too early to really talk about that but should he be considered and in the conversation? I believe absolutely he should.  What he is creating in Boston this season is going to be a serious problem for the East for the next handful of years.",1,37,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

A little too good. All of a sudden a portal appears that spawns the namesakes of NBA teams. The question is: who could I survive?


A Memphis Grizzly


Plan of Action: If not initially aggressive, I would offer the grizzly some, not all, of my Cool Ranch Doritos (still not a sponsor). Then I would slowly shimmy under the bed to safety. I would wait for the grizzly to become bored and to simply leave.


Worst Case Scenario: If you ever met me, you would describe me as 100% American Beef. I am a big boy. There is a fairly decent shot that I would not be able to fit under my bed unless I was buttered up. I would get stuck halfway and the grizzly would eat my ass like a cupcake.


Chance of Survival: 15%


A Phoenix Sun


Plan of Action: Honestly what do you want me to do here?


Worst Case Scenario: The sun is now in my room and known life is burned to a crisp immediately. Every single piece of evidence we find meaningful is now gone, and even if future life finds our burnt planet it will not know we ever existed. Humanity will never be remembered and all of existence was a waste of time.


Chance of Survival: 3%


A Washington Wizard


Plan of Action: I have seen the Wizard of Oz. The Wicked Witch of the West was defeated by water. Unfortunately, the only thing I have next to me is a Diet Mt. Dew (also not a sponsor). Reluctantly, I would take my drink and splash it on him.


Worst Case Scenario: The Diet Mt. Dew is closer related to battery acid than water, and does nothing to harm the wizard. Irritated that he is now wet and sticky, he takes his shaft and punishes me for being a bad boy.


Chance of Survival: 45%


A Toronto Raptor


Plan of Action: How I see things, I only have 3 courses of action.


Option A: I take Jurassic Park’s word for it, and stay perfectly still hoping they do not see me.


Option B: I go for glory and punch the SOB square in the jaw.


Option C: I call ICE to detain the illegal foreigner that is in my room.


Worst Case Scenario: The raptor has all of its immigration paperwork together then proceeds to eat me for dinner.


Chance of Survival: 9%


A Charlotte Hornet


Plan of Action: I notice the Hornet in my room and panic. With no fly swatter, I have to use my bare hands. I repeatedly clap my hands together trying to swat it, but I keep missing. Unfortunately, my lights are attached to The Clapper and my neighbors think I am having a rave. I eventually smack the hornet and win.

Worst Case Scenario: The hornet keeps evading my swats. I repeatedly scream “OH FUCK”. While screaming, the hornet comes down my throat and I choke on its stinger.


Chance of Survival: 97%


The Miami Heat


Plan of Action: All of a sudden it is 85 degrees in my room. I get pretty sweaty but I stay the course and drink my Diet Mt. Dew.


Worst Case Scenario: The heat is so strong it causes my nuts to hang lower than they have ever hung in Ohio. I trip over my own sack and break my neck on impact with the ground.


Chance of Survival: 95%


A Chicago Bull


Plan of Action: I quickly rise to my feet and grab my blanket. My moment has come, Tron Matador. Olé! The Bull runs through my wall and falls down to its death.


Worst Case Scenario: I am the least athletic person you have ever met. I fail to move the blanket and I get penetrated deeply by a bull.


Chance of Survival: 27%


A San Antonio Spur:


Plan of Action: Bruh it is not alive. I literally just walk around it. Come on now.


Worst Case Scenario: My lazy-ass never picks it up, a week later I step on it and slice an artery. I am lying in a pool of my own blood realizing my laziness is my downfall.


Chance of Survival: 64%


A Sacramento King


Plan of Action: Time for my shining moment. I am a jester for your amusement on Twitter and on my website, but this time it is for my life. I say to the king “You’re telling me a shrimp fried this rice?” in hopes of a laugh.


Worst Case Scenario: “I have a Twitter too. I have seen that joke a thousand times. You’re a content stealer” OOF! Using his sword, he rearranges my guts.


Chance of Survival: 42%


The Orlando Magic


(Since magic isn’t tangible, Magic Johnson appears in my room instead)


Plan of Action: Are you kidding me, this is awesome. I invite him to hang out. We watch the NBA together and share my Cool Ranch Doritos. This is honestly the best day of my life. LeBron hits a game winner for the Lakers and we share a high five!


Worst Case Scenario: We both have an open wound on our hand.


Chance of Survival: 81%

2455,58,Zach Lowe's tips for How Not To Talk About MVP (from his latest column):,"""• Do not act as if the winner should *obviously* be Joel Embiid, and that anyone who dares disagree is a dunce. You can make reasonable cases for Embiid, Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, maybe a few others. I might end up voting for Embiid.  


• Current playoff seedings do not constitute a standalone case for Embiid. Yes, the Sixers are No. 3 in the East, and Denver is No. 6 in the West. 1.5 games separate them. The Nuggets have a better point differential. The Sixers have gotten zero from Ben Simmons; the Nuggets have gotten zero from Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.  


Peel back one layer, and you'll realize there is -- to this point -- no qualitative difference between Denver and Philly. If there is one at the end of the season -- if the gap between their records fattens -- let's discuss that then.  


Also: Should we really care that MVPs have historically come from top-two seeds, with the (recent) exception of 2016-17 -- when Russell Westbrook won while averaging a triple-double for the sixth-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder? Just because we've always done something one way doesn't mean that way is ironclad in its correctness. What are people going to say if the Sixers finish No. 4 or 5?  


Westbrook's triple-double -- on 42.5% shooting -- was historic and worthy of celebration. Is that 31.6-10.7-10.4 line so much more significant than Jokic's current 26-14-8 line (on 57% shooting) that we should make an exception for one but not the other? Two assists make that much of a difference?

• Do not push the bogus narrative that you must lean on fancy stats to craft the argument for Jokic. Traditional stats do just fine. Does it count as an ""advanced"" stat that the Nuggets are plus-10 points per 100 possessions with Jokic on the floor, and minus-10.6 when he sits? Is that ""advanced"" or regular math? What are we doing here?""

\--------------------

I know I have Nuggets flair, but I am pretty ambivalent about who wins MVP at this point in time.  I think Embid and Jokic are both deserving. Hell, Giannis is too-- I just think he has more help (even if his team clearly misses Brook Lopez).  And as somebody who just moved to Chicago after 15 years in LA (I grew up in Denver), I'm enjoying the Damar show too. 

What annoys me are conversations around MVP that lack nuance or include stupid talking points (ala Windhorst) or are just blatant nonsense (aka Nick Wrong). Surprisingly, despite the predictable nightly mood swings-- I think r/nba has done a solid job of talking about MVP this year. 

The league is saturated with talent right now. I look forward to seeing how the rest of the year plays out. Fingers crossed the Nuggets get Murray and MPJ back. Fingers crossed the Bucks get Lopez back. And I'll be rooting for Embid playoff time-- until Harden winds up getting under my skin or they wind up playing the Bulls.",1,72,14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

&gt; DeRozan has garnered MVP consideration, but LaVine has always remained the Bulls' central focus ahead of his unrestricted free agency. If LaVine plays his way into an All-NBA bid this season, averaging 24.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.5 assists while shooting nearly 40 percent from three, he'll be eligible for a supermax contract around $245 million over five years. And he'll be worth it. There are only a few two-time All-Stars in the NBA who are 26 years old or younger: Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum and Devin Booker to name a few. 

&gt; For now, this is Chicago's unit, and LaVine told B/R he relished management's aggressive activity thus far. 

&gt; What the Bulls can do beyond this season is another question. There's limited flexibility to make further improvements at this juncture, having dispensed a hoard of draft capital. The Bulls have Portland's 2022 first-rounder, thanks to a creative and stubborn stance on Lauri Markkanan's restricted free agency, but that pick is lottery-protected through 2028. Rival teams surely have interest in acquiring injured second-year forward Patrick Williams, but Chicago brass hardly entertained including Williams in any negotiation for Jerami Grant, sources told B/R.

2470,73,"[Serious] What's DDR got to do to win the MVP (not ""deserve"" it, actually win)?","To answer this question, you've got to understand what voters actually consider (not should consider) in voting for the MVP. Here are some of the things that seem to matter:

1) Efficiency and Advanced Stats - I've grouped these two together. At the moment, DDR is having his best season ever in this regard. However, on a statistical basis, at the risk of over-simplifying, Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid are in a class of their own right now. You have to struggle to make a case for anybody else. The more advanced stats do not love Demar - he is 7th in PER, 16th in WS/48. But he is not terrible.

2) Boxcar stats - Demar is third in scoring, behind Embiid and Giannis, and is good for 5 rebounds and 5 assists a game. Very good! But over still lagging behind the three main candidates listed above. In particular, since scoring is his thing, it would be good for Demar to win the scoring race.

3) Defense - All three of the players mentioned are impactful on defense, including Jokic. Demar is generally speaking not a negative on that end, even with Caruso and Ball out. He's not really helping his case there although he isn't really hurting it that much.

However, right or wrong, those are not the only factors. Let's look at some others voters consider when determining the ultimately subjective question of ""value"".

4) Team success - Currently the Bulls are ahead of both the Bucks and the 76ers. If this continues to the end of the season, it will really help DDR. This is a big factor and it is the main reason people talk about candidates like Chris Paul, Booker and Butler. In particular, keep your eye on Booker while Paul is injured.

5) Overcoming adversity - The Bulls have kept winning despite a rash of injuries hitting an already thin roster. DDR has a nice edge here. However, both Jokic and Embiid can make incredibly strong arguments here as well, especially Jokic, who has single-handedly kept a devastated team not only in the playoffs but out of the playins - in the West.

6) Exceeding expectations - Should this matter? Maybe not. Does it? Yes, I think so. Demar has famously shattered the expectations set for him. A guy like Curry is having a much better season then some people here seem to think, but the expectations for him were very high. Ditto Lebron, Rudy Gobert, etc. This ties into fatigue, below.

7) Signature Moments - DDR has this, obviously, in spades. Indeed it is probably his biggest lead right now. The buzzer beaters, the Wilt-beating streak, he's had great moments, more so than someone like Jokic or Giannis, who are just boringly good.

8) Teammates stealing your thunder - A few weeks ago this was a big one. Lavine was arguably the better player. The injury has turned this on its head. Again, Jokic and Embiid are strong in this category - clearly their team's best players. Giannis suffers because he has strong teammates and his team is a few games back in the standing.

9) Voter fatigue - Should this matter? Again, no. Does it? Absolutely. Jokic won last year and Giannis won twice.  NBA MVP voters like to spread the love around, not to give the award to the same guys over and over. Considering how the NBA has historically been dominated by a few players, there are relatively few multiple MVP winners. Neither Kobe nor Shaq won the award twice.

10) Perceived value - This is kind of subjective - it's driven by the qualitative feeling that some points (say, those scored in the forth quarter) - are more valuable than others. I would say Demar is definitely up there. FWIW (maybe not much) DDR has an INSANE lead in the obscure stat of win probability added (WPA), almost doubling up on the guy behind him. [http://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnPlayer.php](http://stats.inpredictable.com/nba/ssnPlayer.php)

This is one of those things that feels totally wonky yet totally right at the same time. Take it for what it is worth (not much).

CONCLUSION: In my view, Embiid should be viewed as the front-runner for the award. He has great stats, he hasn't won before, he is carrying a weaker team. Both Jokic and Giannis have strong cases as well. Ultimately I think team success in a crowded eastern conference may prove determinative. If the bucks end up no. 1, Giannis may end up with his third.

To win the award, I think DDR needs to do the following:

1) Carry the Bulls to a one or two seed;

2) If possible, win the scoring race (boxcar stat).

3) Maintain respectable advanced stats and strong shooting percentages.

I would not call him the BEST player in the league - we are in a special era with some special players. It's not 2005 anymore. But I do think he has a legitimate shot to win the MVP based on the factors that are traditionally used to win the award.",1,79,15,0.5859,0.0,0.787,0.213

2475,78,Would Demar going on a title run with the Bulls change the perception of the 2018 Raptors team?,"Demar has been on a crazy hot streak lately and also been incredibly clutch throughout the year. He is also the last Raptor of the 2018 team that so many called out to be frauds and were vindicated when Lebron's Cavs swept them in historic fashion. Yet as soon as Lebron was out of the picture, the Raptors jumped on the chance to upgrade at wing by trading Demar for Kawhi. Now most of that roster is seen as championship caliber and the burden of being frauds rests on their former #1 option of Demar.

Let's say Demar and the Bulls keep this momentum going and ends up beating at least one of the Bucks, Nets and or Sixers and even gets to the finals. Wouldn't that mean that the 2018 team was not truly a fraudulent 1 seed as everyone there would then be proven championship caliber? (Note I do not think they could have won with Golden State at the height of their powers). Would they be seen as a championship core with Demar being too young at the time? I think I heard something about his playmaking being developed throughout his Spurs years, but I don't think it was a lack of playmaking from him that decided those losses...

This was also the year the Raptors were a 23 win team in a lockout shortened season. 

For literally almost an entire decade DeMar DeRozan was regularly a positive player for his team on the court, but the team always played better with him off the court. A lot of this went to the magic of Kyle Lowry and the Raptor's organization that turned diamonds in the rought into real studs as solid role players. 

Finally DeRozan was traded for Kawhi Leonard and yet hilariously even on the Spurs, that first season he was a positive on the court, but the team was significantly better with him off the court.

Then two years of bad Spurs teams and no one was winning.

Well finally it has happened and it's not going away, the stats are SET ladies and gentleman. DeMar DeRozan is a +5.6 on the court and a +10.2 to his team between the On and Off scenario. Praise and rejoice to the 82nd best player in the NBA, the worst signing of the off season, DeMar DeRozan.

Luka is averaging more points, assists and rebounds while shooting a better 3% after a good awful start this season. Ja only has a 1.5% better TS% then Luka.

If the Kings hurt their own record and help the Pacers, in theory that could make them move up a few spots in the draft. 

Typically you have to trade like a late first round pick to move up from #7 to like #4. So before evaluating the trade, you should probably price that in to the value the Kings got back.

He likens it to team usa getting their ass kicked in the 04 olympics before they took it seriously. I thought it was an interesting idea and it got me thinking about other out of the box ideas.

What if we had pre recorded dunks, with live votes? Still the same theatrics but less of the attempts, which means the duration of the contest as a whole is controlled. Do we legitimately care about the makes or misses? In previous dunk contests, first to third attempt doesn't really affect the score, but when it gets to more than that it gets annoying. The cons I can think of, is this will be shit for live audience, and we do not get the satisfaction of knowing the dunker did it in one attempt.

Since then they are 16-5 with almost half of those game being 20+ point blowouts(29, 53, 30, 33, 35, 48, 23 point wins). 

More importantly Derrick White has passed the eye test in flying colors in the few games he's been in Boston. He does not need the ball at all on offense which is a welcome sign and knows how to play off ball and playmake for others.",1,68,15,0.2023,0.0,0.886,0.114
2564,67,Is DeMar DeRozan having a better season than MVP Derrick Rose in Chicago?,"Now, I know how special DRose’s MVP season was to millions of NBA fans, but this is a serious question. With DeMar’s ongoing stretch of 8 consecutive games with 35+ points on 50+ FG%, I genuinely believe he is the best player to wear a Bulls jersey since MVP Derrick Rose… and he might be better.

DeMar’s last 8 games:

45 PTS, 9 REB, 7 AST, 60% FG
38 PTS, 5 REB, 4 AST, 59% FG
36 PTS, 5 REB, 4 AST, 68% FG
35 PTS, 6 REB, 6 AST, 63% FG
38 PTS, 6 REB, 5 AST, 50% FG
40 PTS, 3 REB, 7 AST, 67% FG
38 PTS, 6 REB, 6 AST, 59% FG
37 PTS, 6 REB, 3 AST, 71% FG

He’s been super consistent and clutch all season, helping to lead the Bulls to a top seed in the competitive eastern conference.

What do y’all think? Is Deebo or DRose the better Bull? Who is more impactful? Nostalgia aside, I’m genuinely curious to see what y’all think!

2568,71,Did LeBron forget he already had a chance to play with his son?,"If the Lakers threw in more picks for that Kuz+Green for DeMar trade and went through with it LeBron would have gotten to play with his son on a contender.

Also friendly reminder that fans are dumb. 

I also had the same view that sacrificing defense and 3pt shooting role players for a scoring non defensive guard is dumb, well I guess it still is when you look at Westbrook. 

&gt; It's such an unbelievably stupid trade that I refuse to believe the Lakers are actually considering it.

&gt; There's no way Rob Pelinka does this. Magic would do this in a heartbeat tho we're lucky he's gone

&gt; He's a great player but it's redundant to pay him 27 mil to be a primary playmaker and score during the 15 minutes Lebron sits

&gt; Seriously, it would be an awful move. What you gain in having a competent 3rd iso scorer does not make up for the defense and spacing you lose. It just is not a move that makes any sense.

&gt; Imagine taking touches away from the greatest playmaker in the game, and the best big man in the game, and giving it to a guy whose primary strength is the least efficient shot in the sport that gets even less efficient in the playoffs.

&gt; It's a god awful idea that falls into the thinking the Cavs had with trading Kyrie for injured Isaiah Thomas.

&gt; He doesnt have the positional and defensive versatility like a Chris Bosh to be an effective 3rd wheel in a big 3 featuring Lebron. Not to mention a 3 point shot. Destined for failure.

&gt; God I can't imagine the thought process behind a team that is only concerned about the playoffs letting go of Rondo in favor of DeRozan.",1,63,13,0.3612,0.124,0.588,0.288

I don't keep up with big metrics aside from eye tests, but I personally think that LeBron drives enough to warrant some more fouls, even if it isn't the same level as the two big men. Another interesting note would be that Giannis and Embiid have both MADE more free throws than LeBron has ATTEMPTED. If LeBron had 500 free throw attempts this year, assuming he kept the same percentage as he is currently shooting, he would be averaging roughly 34 PPG, which would blow out his previous career high.

2610,13,"D'Angelo Russell tonight: 37 PTS (23 in Q4), 9 AST, and a W over Memphis","D'Angelo Russell showed everyone why Minnesota traded for him tonight, putting the team on his back in the 4th quarter and willing them to a narrow, hard-fought victory over Memphis. He had a season-high 37 points, with 23 of them in the 4th quarter. His heroics were especially necessary tonight, with Anthony Edwards having another off game, and Karl-Anthony Towns being in constant foul trouble.

2662,65,Questions from someone new to watching NBA basketball,"I know the basics of basketball and I wouldn't be totally lost if I watched a game.  However, there are a bunch of little things I can't figure out, and I couldn't find an /r/nba equivalent of /r/hockey's Tenderfoot Tuesday.  I'd appreciate it if people could help explain some things to me.  It's perfectly fine if a response only addresses 1 of the questions instead of trying to answer everything in a single comment:

1) What do the markings inside of the paint mean?  I think the dotted circle is for jump balls.  I'm not sure what [this thing circled in purple](https://imgur.com/a/znKpAAM) is for, nor do I understand the role of the semi-circle that's basically under the net.  (I'm guessing the semi-circle marks more than just the place where the goalie can cover the puck after the wood floor is removed.)

2) If the player dribbling the ball collides with a defender, what determines whether that's a charging foul against the offense or a blocking foul on the defense?  I've heard the explanation that the defender must be ""set"" but that doesn't really clarify things.

3) I don't remember the specifics, but I recall seeing a play where a player committed a foul but the team was still at 0 team fouls.  Which fouls count toward a team's foul count and which fouls do not?

4) I've got a whole bunch of questions about foul bonuses: How many fouls puts the other team in the bonus?  Is a team considered to be in the bonus when the upcoming foul would come with guaranteed foul shots or does the bonus start after the first foul that comes with the guaranteed foul shots?  Does the NBA have something like college's Bonus+, where there's something more extreme than the regular Bonus if a team goes overboard with fouls?

5) Does an assist go to the last player who passes the ball to the scorer or is an assist only awarded if the assist was proximal enough to the scoring shot?  For example, if Player A passes the ball to Player B, then Player B dribbles around for 20 seconds before shooting, would  Player A still get an assist?

6) Does the ball have to bounce off the backboard or the rim for there to be a rebound?  In other words, would a player get credit for a rebound if they recovered a blocked shot or an airball?

7) How interchangeable are the different positions?  For example, if someone normally plays Point Guard, would it be assumed that they could fill in as a Shooting Guard when needed?  And is it common for players to alternate between positions throughout a game (e.g. playing Point Guard when on a line with a particularly shooty Shooting Guard then switching to Shooting Guard when a particularly pointy Point Guard subs in)?

8) I was playing a basketball video game in which there was a player on the Nuggets called Bol Bol.  Is there really a B-baller named Bol Bol who balls in Ball Arena?  

9) Is there any actual rule that the most annoying buzzer sound possible has to be used during a player substitution or could a team choose to use another noise in their arena?

10) Truth be told, I've run out of questions, but a 10-part list is so much neater than a 9-part list.  I guess I'll ask: Is there anything in the rule book that says a dog can't play basketball?",1,53,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

2666,69,Portland Should Trade Damian Lillard,"Hello. So, I recently made a video about how the Washington Wizards should trade Bradley Beal. I feel the same way about the Portland Trailblazers and Damian Lillard. I know he doesn’t want to get traded, but he should be, for his sake and the team’s sake. It’s really a win-win for both parties. Here’s why.

Two of the last three seasons are losing seasons for Portlandia. They fired their head coach after last year too. That’s a bad trend. Damian Lillard is also going to be 32 years old this off season, coming off an injury, and when he was playing, he wasn’t playing up to his usual standard. Again, that’s a bad trend. Trading Damian Lillard away to start a rebuild just makes sense. 

During the Damian Lillard era there has only been one conference finals appearance. Everything else has been first or second round losses. If your goal is to win a championship, you have enough data to show that this current iteration lead by Dame isn’t going to work. You might say, “well they never put another superstar next to Dame”. You’re right, but they also never will. Portland is not a free agent destination. They never have been and never will be. Even if they managed to trade for a superstar, that player probably wouldn’t resign and stick around. It’s sad, but Portland needs to be honest about who they are. If they’re ever going to build a champion, they’ll have to do it through the draft. That’s why trading Damian Lillard away for as many draft picks as they can get would be the smart move. 

A trade would also benefit Damian Lillard. He’s been loyal to Portland. No one would hate him for leaving. Dame has long been one of the best, most underrated players in the league. Imagine what he could do on a bigger stage. Imagine how his star power would rise. He might have a few more great years left in him. He shouldn’t be wasting those years on a slightly above average team. He deserves to be on a contender. Next to Chris Paul getting a championship, I think Damian Lillard would be next on fans wish list to get a title. 

There are a ton of trade scenarios out there, but Portland should look at what Oklahoma City is doing. The Thunder traded away Paul George and Russell Westbrook and have so much young talent right now. Portland could do the same thing. They already traded CJ McCollum. Damian Lillard should be next. Start over. Start the process and see what Anfernee Simmons can be. Personally, I don’t think he’ll ever be more than a good stats-bad team kind of guy, but you never know. He could really develop the next few years. 

Portland can’t let the playoff game winners and one conference championship cloud their judgement. They need to be honest with what they have and the direction they are going. That’s why the time is right to trade Damian Lillard. Another bad year or another injury could ruin his value. The time to act is now. What do you think?

This has been one of the most intriguing seasons in recent memory; several players are having fantastic season, lots of young talent taking over the league, but the greats of the last 10 years not quite done yet. Lots do be debated, so let's talk about it. Here are my teams:

&amp;#x200B;

1st Team

G: Ja Morant

G: DeMar Derozan

F: Giannis

F: LeBron

C: Embiid

&amp;#x200B;

2nd Team

G: Steph Curry

G: Devin Booker

F: Jayson Tatum

F:  KD (Assuming he'll come back relatively soon?)

C: Jokic

&amp;#x200B;

3rd Team

G: Luka

G: Trae Young 

F: Jimmy Butler

F: Zach Lavine

C: KAT

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the biggest debates I had:

Where does CP3 fit in? Given the Suns' success, it feels wrong to not have CP somewhere on this list. However, given he will likely miss the rest of the regular season, I had a hard time putting him about any of the guards listed. 

Darius Garland? I'm a big believer in Garland. He's one of the best floor generals and leaders in the league. The best player on one of the best teams in the East. But not quite better than any of the guards listed yet. 

Steph not 1st team? Look, I'm a Mavs fan but also a big Steph homer. I watch nearly every GSW game. As well as he was at the beginning of the season, Steph has not been at his best for most of the season. Too many off games. Last season was one of the greatest shooting displays I've ever seen, and Steph just hasn't been nearly close to that level for a while. That being said, if he picks it up post ASG, he could easily be 1st team. 

Luka and Trae 3rd team? Luka started the season poorly. He was chubby and had COVID. He's definitely picked it up, though. As a Mavs fan, I'm hoping he plays well enough to move up a bit. Trae's team just hasn't been consistent enough - that's definitely not fully on him but hard to put him above guys who are the driving forces behind leading teams. 

Jokic vs Embiid? I go to college in Philly. The only 3 NBA games I've ever watched in person featured Joel. He's carrying the city right now. I'm a bit biased. Jokic is a top 3 player in the league, though.",1,23,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

How do you even explain their 73 win season at that point? If Curry with 1 star SG and good role players beat the '96 Bulls record.

Not even Lebron had a stretch that dominant and he played with players alot better than Thomspon and Green (who is not a legit star in certain minds).

Why were the Cavs even considered underdogs? Why were they even down 3-1? Kevin Love is a legit 20+ PPG sccrer, realistically he is on another tier of Green.

2736,39,"If you have to rely on team accomplishments or only consider a tiny percentage of an individual career, you're making excuses","It's really getting to a fever pitch now. And I'm not gonna name names but it's obvious who this is all about. But just want to appeal to common sense here.

If you're having an all-time debate about an individual player and try to make it all about team accomplishments like wins, rings etc what you're really saying is individually the person you're defending can't measure up and are trying to divert attention away from their actual play as individuals. People trying to say T-Mac &lt; I dunno, Richard Hamilton but only wants to talk about playoff success is just making an excuse for Rip cuz they can't win their argument on their actual play.

If you're trying to limit the discussion to something like ""finals record"" you're just making an excuse and actually admitting that their whole freaking career is inferior to the point you won't even discuss it since you already know you will lose.

If you're claiming ""oh man you can't compare eras"" you're just making an excuse. It's really easy to compare eras. You just watch games from those eras and evaluate players as you always would. The funny thing is that no one ever makes the era excuse till someone from an era gets obviously passed and only 'then' is it all about eras. Bob Cousy's handles are shit, he has no jumper and he would get positively worked by back up PGs today. He'd get worked by plenty of HS PGs today. The difference between his era and this one is that HS Dame would win 10 straight MVPs in the 50s and 60s. Claiming they deserve to be in the discussion because of eras is just an excuse to have them in a discussion they positively do not belong is.

I don't get why people think making excuses to protect players from the past, who never, ever, ever required that kind of protection or excuses before, somehow elevates them. Lets admit what it is. Every time someone needs to make excuses and ignore an individul's actual individual accomplishments and entire career it's the true indicator they've been passed.",1,125,21,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

&gt; ""The relationship was fine,"" Curry said. ""He wasn't around. So I don't know what \[Green\] meant by that. 'Wasn't cordial,' I don't know what that means, but the relationship was fine. He just wasn't around so we didn't see him a lot or we didn't talk a lot. But as far as now, he's on my \[team\]. I went to battle with him last year, we did a lot of good stuff and I'm going to go to war with who I'm going to go to war with and who's on my team, so I'm looking forward to getting back out there with him and doing good stuff.""

Spurs and Warriors being the exception has any team had a championship window longer than 3 years without a change in their first 3 options 

And again, Duncan took a pay cut and Spurs traded for Kawhi and Danny Green. Warriors got the new cap rules, hence the KD and when he left got 2 years to retool to a completely new bench and depth.",1,75,13,0.6486,0.0,0.654,0.346

2748,51,Who is the best player on the Suns right now?,"Chris Paul and Devin Booker have led the Suns to an incredibly dominant regular season. Although CP3 will be out due to injury, what the Suns have accomplished so far is nothing short of incredible. What's interesting about this team is that they don't seem to have a clear cut best player; CP3 and DBook are both having excellent seasons, but because their respective roles are so different, its hard to compare the two. This has had the consequence of preventing either of them from having a real shot at MVP despite being the main contributors to the team with by far the best record in the league. 

I wanted to hear people's thoughts on this comparison. It'd be cool to see arguments and analysis of who is having the better season between CP3 and DBook.

For reference, here are their box score stats and shooting splits:

Devin Booker: 25.5 PTS/4.5 AST/5.2 TRB/2.4 TOV on 44.6/36.9/86.3 (55.5% TS)

Many throw around the stat that Jordan was 1-9 in the playoffs without Pippen and did not get out of the first round until Pippen joined the team in the 1987-88 season.

This is *technically* true:

- In 1985 Jordan averaged 29.3 pts/5.8 reb/8.5 ast/2.8 stl/1.0 blk against the 59-23 Bucks, losing 3-1
- In 1986 Jordan averaged 43.7 pts/6.3 reb/5.7 ast/2.7 stl/1.3 blk against the 67-15 Celtics, losing 3-0
- In 1987 Jordan averaged 35.7 pts/7.0 reb/6.0 ast/2.0 stl/2.3 blk against the 59-23 Celtics, losing 3-0

In 1987-88, Scottie Pippen joined the team. 

- In the regular season, **Scottie Pippen started 0 games and averaged 7.9 pts/3.8 reb/2.1 ast/1.2 stl/0.7 blk**. This was in 20 minutes per game.

- In the regular season, **Michael Jordan averaged 35.0 ppg/5.5 reb/5.9 ast/3.2 stl/1.6 blk, winning MVP, DPOY, and the scoring title.** No one else has ever won these three awards in a single season.

So what happened in that first playoff series together? In the 1988 first round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers,
 
- **Pippen started 1 game. He was 5th in minutes played for the Bulls. He averaged 10.6 pts/5.2 reb/2.4 ast/0.8 stl/1.0 blk.** Stellar numbers for a rookie without a doubt, not taking anything away from Pippen. Game 5 was possibly the best game of his career up to that point.

- **Jordan averaged 45.2 ppg/5.4 reb/4.8 ast/2.8 stl/1.6 blk.** Jordan would go on to average 40+ppg in 5 playoff series, a feat no one else has accomplished more than once.

- The Bulls won the series 3-2.

Scottie Pippen would go on to become the most important asset for the Bulls after Jordan. Did he ""get Jordan out of the first round?"" I think that is debatable but it was not a popular sentiment at that time. He was not considered the second-best player on the team at this point.

RAPM is unique in that it completely ignores box score stats (points, rebounds, assists, etc...) and instead looks only at team points scored and team points allowed. RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus Minus) is a form of [adjusted plus minus](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/) that adjusts for the quality of teammates and opponents and controls for irregularities. RAPM looks at all ""stints"" (possessions between substitutions) throughout the season, looks at the 10 players on the floor for each stint, and runs linear regressions to determine each player's impact. 

In very simple terms:

* **Plus-minus (PM)**: Net points while a player was on the floor

* **Adjusted plus-minus (APM)**: Plus-Minus adjusted for quality of teammates and opponents

* **Regularized Adjusted Plus Minus (RAPM)**: Uses a ridge regression to adjust APM for collinearity (players who play exclusively with each other and players who exclusively substitute for each other) and other irregularities.

RAPM has a lot of limitations, especially in small samples, but it's generally a [good overview](https://hoopshype.com/lists/advanced-stats-nba-real-plus-minus-rapm-win-shares-analytics/) of player impact divorced from box score stats. Most of the modern impact metrics (EPM, RAPTOR, LEBRON) combine RAPM with box score stats and tracking data.

Here are the [top 10 RAPM for the past 5 regular seasons](http://nbashotcharts.com/rapm5?id=-1129977058) (2017-2018 through 2021-2022):

**On JJ Reddick’s Comments:**

“ I was surprised actually that JJ came out and said that. I know for a fact that JJ really likes Zion.”

**On Reports that Zion is “Detached”:**

“Zion at times can certainly be detached. When he’s playing I didn’t think he was detached at all last year. But when he’s not playing - off-season, breaks, injured, whatever - I think he just wants to be by himself. I think he doesn’t like not playing, he wants to be by himself and get ready, that’s a big part of it. And at that point all he wants to do is get back and play to re-attach.”

2814,17,NBA Players Scoring Changes vs. Best and Worst Defenses,"I wanted to see how a player's scoring changed when they faced the best and worst defenses in the league. 

I decided to look at the top ~20 scorers per 75 possessions from pbpstats. Please note that there are players who aren't qualified to be on this list due to not enough mins/games played. I used a filter of 25 mins per game and 40 games played.

To determine the best and worst defenses, I used [Cleaning the Glass' Defensive Ratings listed on their Four Factors page](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors). I like using theirs because they [exclude garbage time and possessions at the end of quarters that are highly likely to end up in a heave](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/guide/garbage_time). Due to the distribution of how the defensive ratings looked, I split each player's stats vs top 11 defenses, middle 8 defenses, and bottom 11 defenses. I also included how many possessions they played against each level of defense, and how many pts their team scored while they were on the floor (ORTG).

2819,22,[Feldman] Subscribe: Draymond Green laments suspension costing him 2016 NBA Finals MVP: ‘Good luck leaving me off the NBA 75 if I was Finals MVP,"&gt;Green has also emphasized the silver lining of the Warriors losing that series. Kevin Durant said he wouldn’t have joint them that summer if they had just won the title. With Durant, Golden State won the next two championships and then another Western Conference crown. The Warriors arguably had more total success than they would’ve if Green didn’t get suspended. But there’s one aspect of the suspension Green won’t sugarcoat. Green on “The Old Man &amp; The Three“: “The one thing, when I look back on it, that bothers me is I would’ve been the Finals MVP. And that totally changes the narrative. Good luck leaving me off the NBA 75 if I was Finals MVP. Good luck even having a debate if I’m a Hall of Famer or not if I was Finals MVP.” “When I look back on that from a selfish standpoint, which I rarely do, I would have been Finals MVP and that changes the course of everything.”

&gt;I really dominated that game. So, it sucks that we didn’t win it, because you’d always hear about that performance had we won. So, that bothers me. But there’s an old adage: In the end, you normally get what you deserve. And I got what I deserved.

&gt;Whether it was right or wrong – do I think I should’ve been suspended? No, I didn’t hit him. I got upgraded to a flagrant foul for trying to hit him. I tried. I definitely tried. He’s on my shoulder. But I missed.

2831,34,Why did Embiid's game not scale well to the playoffs (in the past)?,"Embiid in his first-ever playoffs - His numbers against both Miami and Boston and poor compared to what was expected of him. 

Note - He played great defense in 2018.

**2018**

|Team|MP|Splits|Shooting Splits|Turovers per game|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Miami (2018)|31.0|19/10/2|42/37/70 |5|
|Boston (2018)|37.4|23/14/3|44/24/71|3|

Embiid in his 2nd playoff run against D'lo Nets and  Toronto - The numbers were lacklustre again for a superstar. 

Note - He was good defensively against Toronto and had excellent on-off numbers. But, he had poor numbers and shooting splits.

**2019**

|Team|MP|Splits|Shooting Splits|Turovers per game|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nets (2019)|24|25/13/3|51/23/80|3|
|Raptors (2019)|34|18/9/3|37/34/84|4|

In his 3rd playoff run, with Simmons out due to injury. 

Embiid really struggled to guard Tatum and Brown in space and Boston swept the Sixers. 

**2020**

|Team|MP|Splits|Shooting Splits|Turovers per game|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Boston (2020)|36|30/12/1|46/25/81|4|

In his latest playoff run, he had excellent numbers in both series but the team bowed out to the Hawks despite being major favourites heading into the series. His shooting struggles in game 4 (4-20) lost the team a close game. Although he was excellent in most other games. 

**2021**

|Team|MP|Splits|Shooting Splits|Turovers per game|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wizards (2021)|24|24/6/2|63/46/89|2|

- Trading Russell Westbrook because it is clear that this experiment has failed but where do you trade Westbrook to? Not to mention can you get anything back for him by that I mean draft picks because the Lakers have no first round picks until 2027 essentially mortgaged their future with all sorts of moves. But even if you can get draft compensation, what else do you get back for Russ? Also have to be willing to find a team who would want Russ 

- But also it just may be time to trade Anthony Davis. I hate to say it but you have to trade AD. Why? AD is not only injury prone especially now that he's starting to get older. Yeah the elite potential is there when he's healthy but the reliability factor you have to consider. Problem is getting LeBron to sign off on it.

**SAME RULES**

We all know Nba is League of Superteams. And will probably there to stay.

I will exclude older superstars like Lebron, Steph, KD, Cp3 and the likes.

I am referring to the younger superstars. Like Luka, Giannis, Embiid, Trae, Jokic,  Booker, Tatum, Brown, Simmons, Zion, Ja, etc. 

1. Who among them you THINK will teamed up to form a superteam?

2. Who among them you LIKE to teamed up to form a superteam to win a ring, and possibly established a dynasty?


**Side Notes:**

Superteams that will be created due to FA or Trade. 
Not thru drafts. (Not saying Drafted Superteam is not a superteam, but in this context, let's set them aside)

**Ok, I lied 1 Rule Change. It could be a dynamic duo if both players are both a Top 10 player in the league during their teamed Up.**

2881,84,Would Brent Barry be an All-Star today?,"Brent Barry in the 01-02 season has always been a weird fascination of mine. If 2002 Barry was playing now, I think Zach Lowe or Kevin O'Connor would be writing articles about how he needs an expanded role or he might be worth 100 million as a Super Role Player. Let's break it down. 

* He averaged 14 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and just under 2 steals a game. On paper, that's a pretty solid season, nothing too amazing. Then you look under the hood...

* As a guard, Barry led the league in 2 point field goal percentage at 58.8%. He also shot 42% from 3 (actually 5% down from the previous season), 84% from the Free Throw Line, and the led the league in EFG%!

* His usage rate was only 16.2%!!! For reference, that put him at 145th in the NBA in 2002, and would be 146th in 2022 (right behind guys like Precious Achiuwa, Jeff Green, Chuma Okeke, and Garry Harris). So the most efficient scorer who was also dishing five assists a game, was not even a third option really. The ball should have been in his hands way more. Then again, one could argue maybe he was able to dominate because he wasn't in a lesser role. 

* You look at the On/Off Metrics and for his entire career, and Barry basically always was a plus defender, borderline All-NBA some seasons. The guy was a dunk contest champion and was super athletic/mobile.  He wasn't just a JJ Redick/Luke Kennard type, Barry was a legit two-way player. 

* He was 7th in VORP for the entire season above guys like Dirk, Kobe, J-Kidd and a whole lot of All Stars. Obviously, Brent Barry was a scrub compared to those guys. Still, finishing Top 10 in VORP isn't something a shmuck player accidentally falls into. Since, 2000, the only two players to finish Top 10 who've never made an All-Star are Brent Barry in 2002, and then Josh Smith who did it twice (4th in 2010, 10th in 2012). If modern analytics existed in 02, he maybe flat out makes the All Star team then.

* You look at all this put together and the way the NBA game has shifted directly toward Barry's strengths have me assuming that he would be a prime target for every team in Free Agency. 2002 Brent Barry was basically a more efficient version of Prime Utah Gordon Hayward, except he was treated as a 4th option, whereas Hayward was given the keys as a 1st option. 


Regardless, I think Barry is a massively underrated player in NBA history, and for a nerd like myself, his 2002 season is a fun one to look back on.",1,39,7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

2901,4,30+ Yrs Old Non-MVP Nba Superstars/Stars All Time Status?,"These are the current nba superstars/stars who  are already 30 yrs old or above. Consequently, it is either they are in the last part of their prime, or pass their absolute prime. Also, they are the ones who didn't win MVP in their career so far. Now, Let's see and discuss where they rank all time (Though we will all have different opinions and rankings)

**LIST FROM OLDEST TO YOUNGEST**

**1 .Carmelo Anthony - 37 (NO MVP)**

Melo, one of the best isolation scorers in the history of Nba. His defense is really not that good and consistent though. And he lacks playoffs success as the Main Star in Nuggets and Knicks. 

I still think he belongs to Top 50 all time players. Around 40th -50th

**2.CP3 - 36 (NO MVP)**

He had a slight case for MVP last season. And that was amazing as a 35 yrs old nba veteran. This is maybe a hot take, But Imo, CP3 ranks higher than Melo in All time rankings.  Just because Cp3's ability to elevate almost any team. And his post season failures kinda a little bit offset by his Conf finals apperance with Rockets, and Finals appearance with Suns.

Cp3 would probably also in my 40th -50th range. But a little bit higher than Melo. 

**3.Dwight Howard - 36 (NO MVP)**

For those who are teenagers right now, I bet most if you didn't even know how great Dwight was with Magic in that 2010, when he beat lebron in conf finals. Causing us a Kobe VS Lebron Finals. He was a defensive monster, and a dominant inside force.

Dwight, I think ranges from 60th-70th range all time

**4.Demar Derozan - 32 (NO MVP)**

Derozan is having a better season. But as of the current status in his career. I doubt he will even crack my Top 100 all time list in 2047. (Assuming Derozan will not have another leap  next seasons)

**5.Jimmy Butler - 32 (NO MVP)**

Same thing as Demar. Nice achievement leading Miami to Finals Appearance last season. But he would probably not crack my top 100 also. Unless he have another big leap next seasons.

**6.Klay Thompson - 32 (NO MVP)*""

Klay was never a first option in a team. It was/is KD or Steph. So he is either Joker or Alfred to Batman. 
Having said that, I believe he should have at least been included in the top 75 list.

I will say he is in that 60th-70th range. But a little lower than Dwight. Since Dwight was the clear  best player in a Finals Team. 

**7.Damian Lilliard -31 (NO MVP)**

Dame made the Top 75 list. But I think he barely made it. He is one of the best shooters, and clutch shooters in the history of nba. But we all know his struggles with Portland, especially in the playoffs. 

He is definitely in my 70-75th range all time


**8.Paul George - 31 (NO MVP)**

He also didn't made the Top 75 all time list. But imo, he have a case to be included. Especially considering his stint with the Pacers. Forcing Lebron's Heatles into a Game 7 in a conference finals. With Clippers, he is like a Joker to Kawhi, but still he is the clear 2nd best player. Needs to add more to his legacy though to cement his list for that top 100 all timelist.

Personally, I have him maybe in 70-75th range too same with Dame.

**9.Kawhi Leonard -30 (NO MVP)**

Hmm. Interestingly, he never won an MVP, but he have some solid All Nba Selections. He also have 2 Finals MVP, 1 All Star Game MVP, and multiple all defensive 1st selections. Arguably, he will be the highest ranked among these list when their careers are all set and done. 

He is maybe in my 30th-35th range, but can easily improve to 20th-25th range if he goes healthier and be more successful the following seasons.

What if all shooting fouls resulted in automatic points for the player who was fouled instead of having said player shoot free throws?

Negative impact: it would discourage defenses from attempting to alter shots which may or may not go in, not wanting to risk a foul. Additionally, NBA players having to be decent free throw shooters would be a less important trait to have (non-shooting fouls in the bonus would still be prevalent in this scenario, so being a decent free throw shooter would still have some impact.)

Positive impact: defenses are held to a higher standard and cant be “bailed out”. They can no longer blindly foul a shitty foul shooter like an Andre Drummond or a Rudy Gobert.

I would say that it’s pretty reasonable that the suns don’t currently have a top 5 player. 

With that in mind it brings the question of how many teams have actually won without one.

- looking back since 2000 

2021 - Yes, Giannis 

2020 - Yes, LeBron/AD 

2019 - Yes, Kawhi 

2018 - Yes, KD/Curry

2017 - Yes, KD/Curry

2016 - Yes, LeBron 

2015 - Yes, Curry 

2014 - ? (While no individual was top 5 that season the Spurs still had Kawhi, Tony Parker, Duncan and Ginobili) 

2013 - Yes, LeBron 

2012 - Yes, LeBron 

2011 - Probably, Dirk 

2010 - Yes, Kobe 

2009 - Yes, Kobe 

2008 - Maybe, Garnett (arguable but still had a combo of Ray Allen, Paul Pierce etc. If he wasn’t) 

2007 - Maybe, Duncan 

2006 - Yes, Wade 

2005 - Yes, Duncan 

2004 - No, :( 

2003 - Yes, Duncan 

2002 - Yes, Shaq 

2001 - Yes , Shaq 

2000 - Yes, Shaq

So no team since 2014 and only a potential 4/21 (realistically less) of the last 21 finals has a team won without a top 5 caliber player.

- I’m not liking those odds if I’m a suns fan

2. Golden State Warriors +475
3. Brooklyn Nets +550
4. Milwaukee Bucks +600

You have to get to the 6th place Heat before you find a team with double the odds of the favorites and that's imo undervaluing the Heat's chances.

Last season at the same time, the Lakers &amp; Nets were the overwhelming favorites at +250 and +300.  

The Clippers had double the odds of the Lakers at +500 and were third.  Followed by the Bucks at +700, Jazz at +900 and the 76ers at +1200.

Similarly for most of the past decades one or two teams like the Warriors, Heat, Cavs, Spurs, Lakers &amp; Celtics who were usually at 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 favorites to win the title.

My point is the dunk contest would be way more enjoyable with big name superstars. Not to discredit Obi toppin and the rest of the dunkers this year, but I simply didn’t feel that hair raising feeling I got when I saw Vince carter dunk his whole elbow in the ring.

3010,13,Calvin Murphy: Examining how a 1x NBA All-Star made it into the Basketball Hall of Fame,"Calvin Murphy is a player that people often use as an example to criticize the perceived low standard of entering into the Basketball Hall of Fame. After all, only once in his career did Murphy make an NBA All-Star team. And the only other individual achievement in his NBA career was making the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 1971. But upon further examination, one can perhaps better understand the decision to induct Calvin Murphy into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

A 5’9 and 165 pound Point Guard, Calvin Murphy was aggressively fearless on the basketball court, scorching opposing defences offensively, while being a defence force himself. During his college years at Niagara, Murphy put the country on full notice of his scoring abilities, averaging 33.1 PPG during his 3 years in college, including a 68 point game against Syracuse. At the end, Murphy was a 2x consensus first-team all American, and a 1x consensus second-team all American. He made the all-American team every year of his collegiate career.

Once Murphy left college, he was drafted by the San Diego Rockets in 1970. The team would relocate to Houston a year later. Averaging a solid 20PPG/2RPG/4APG for his career, Murphy was one of the Houston Rockets’s best players. During his career, he scored in bunches for the Rockets, even averaging 20+ PPG in 5 seasons, and by the time he retired from professional basketball, he was the Houston Rockets’s all-time leading scorer. Murphy was also a defensive presence that was felt, obtaining just under 2 SPG in numerous seasons.

In addition to all of this, Calvin Murphy also excelled at free throw shooting. In fact, he is considered to be one of the great free-throw shooters in NBA history, having the second highest free throw percentage in any season in NBA history (95.8%). Murphy also shot over 90% from the foul line in 6/13 seasons, and even more amazingly, shot over 85% in every single year of his career except rookie year (82%).

Playing with multiple legends of the game such as Elvin Hayes and Moses Malone, Murphy was a part of a rough time in Rocket history. Despite having some later success in the post season, Murphy was never able to lead the Houston Rockets to an NBA championship.

Based on all this, it is a surprise as to why Calvin Murphy only made 1 NBA all-star team in his career, and no all-NBA teams. Perhaps it is because of the tremendous competition he faced at the guard positions, competing with players like Pete Maravich, Walt Frazier,  Earl Monroe, Jerry Wear, and Gail Goodrich. Perhaps it is because of the lack of playoff success that he had. 

Nonetheless, the lack of individual achievement in the NBA is often used as an argument that Murphy should not be in the Basketball Hall of Fame. While this is absolutely understandable (as the NBA is the highest level of basketball), it is important to remember that the Hall takes into account all levels of basketball, and not just the NBA. Calvin Murphy’s absolutely dominant collegiate career is what may have pushed the voters to indict him into the Basketball Hall Of Fame.",1,87,16,0.4404,0.0,0.828,0.172

I know they weren’t on the most cordial terms when he was in Philly with [Andre Drummond and Seth Curry].""","&gt; Sanford: On March 10th, he can potentially return to Wells Fargo Center as a member of the Brooklyn Nets and he can play against you. When the game is over, are you shaking hands?

&gt; Green: First, let's break that down. Interesting dynamic of how things went down. Interesting dynamic of who went with him. I haven't had a chance to talk to those guys yet, but I know they weren't on the most cordial terms when he was in Philly with [Andre Drummond and Seth Curry]. So I wonder how that relationship is now.

&gt; Now will we shake hands to start? Probably not. First, I'd be highly surprised if he even plays in that game. I don't know where his health is mentally, physically, I know he had other issues, and we all know he does not like to play in Philly. If he does play in that game, I'd be highly surprised. But say that does happen, I see it as being a very hectic, playoff-like atmosphere and environment to where it may be very rough for him. I don't have any ill will toward the guy, I don't hate him I don't dislike him, it's just for me, it's whatever. I waste more energy going out of my way to dislike him, or spend energy trying to go out of my way to hate him or do things to him. If he comes up and shows love, I'll say what's up, that's the type of deal I'm on. I'm not the type of guy to not say what's up to people that say what's up to me.

&gt; Sanford: Let bygones be bygones.

&gt; Green: That's it, let bygones be bygones. I understand you have a mental health issue, I understand you don't want to play where you want to — whatever it is, you did what you needed to do to make better for you in your life. That's cool. Do I think you could have handled it better? For sure, because we had nothing against you as teammates, still have nothing against you. But it all depends on how that game goes, how he interacts in that game, how well he plays or how cleanly or non-cleanly he or us plays against each other, is going to determine how we shake hands. But I highly doubt he plays in that game, and if he does, I highly doubt he wants to shake hands before or after that game. [Inside the Green Room]

I don’t know where his health is — mentally, physically, I know he had other issues — and we all know he does not like to play in Philly. So if he does play in that game, I’d be highly surprised.

&gt;”But say that does happen? I see it as being a very hectic playoff-like environment, atmosphere, to where it may be very rough for him. Depending on how he acts — I don’t have any ill wills towards the guy. I don’t hate him, I don’t dislike him, it’s just — for me it’s whatever. I don’t waste more energy going out of my way to dislike him or spend any more energy trying to go out of my way to hate him or do things to him.

&gt;”If he comes up and shows love, I’ll say ‘What’s up?’ That’s the type of deal I’m on…  But it all depends on how that game goes, how he interacts in that game and how well he plays, how cleanly or non-cleanly he or us plays against each other. That’s going to determine how we shake hands. But I highly doubt he plays in that game, and if he does I highly doubt he wants to shake hands before or after that game.”",1,297,60,0.8065,0.033,0.787,0.179

&gt;Adams’ remarks triggered speculation on social media that unvaccinated Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving will be able to play home games at Barclays Center again after being barred from doing so because gyms and fitness centers are covered by the “Key to NYC” program.

&gt;But even if “Key to NYC” is lifted, Irving may not be able to play at Barclays because of the city’s private employer mandate, which requires vaccinations for all employees of Big Apple-based private companies, including the Brooklyn Nets.

&gt;Though he’s targeting “Key to NYC” for tweaks, Adams has no plans to revisit the private employer mandate, according to a City Hall official.

The news today was about Mayor Adams lifting the ""Key to NYC"" mandate.

3036,39,Post All-Star Break Season Standing Predictions,"Here to amend my end of the year standings since we have more context and information regarding who is and isn't available for their respective teams.

I'd love to hear any takes you all have on my predictions, or of your own regarding any team.

&amp;#x200B;

**Eastern Conference:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1** Philadelphia 76ers

**2** Chicago Bulls

**3** Milwaukee Bucks

**4**  Miami Heat

**5** Cleveland Cavaliers

**6** Brooklyn Nets

**7** Charlotte Hornets

**8** Atlanta Hawks

**9** Toronto Raptors

**10** Boston Celtics

**11** New York Knicks

**12** Washington Wizards

**13** Indiana Pacers

**14** Detroit Pistons

**15** Orlando Magic

&amp;#x200B;

**Philadelphia 76ers:** While Embiid plays they win most every game they play, but now they traded away someone who was sitting out the season for an MVP caliber running mate to help share the load. Philly is only two games out of the first seed right now, and they are only going to get much better once Harden starts playing for them. They didn't even lose depth in the trade outside of backup center, but Embiid is seeing the floor most of the game anyway, so having Millsap or Niang play small ball center isn't an issue for short stretches.

**Chicago Bulls:** Chicago is tied for the first seed by record, and they have been hit maybe the hardest this year by the injury bug. Luckily everyone should be coming back maybe barring Pat Williams. I really like the Tristan Thompson signing for the Bulls, it's been my opinion that the backup big spot has been by far the worst hole for this team all year, and short spurts of him is still very good. If I didn't think Philly was going to run through most of the rest of the season, I'd have Chicago as the #1 seed favorites, and I won't be surprised if they exceed my expectations

**Milwaukee Bucks:** I hope Lopez comes back sooner rather than later so he can get into rhythm before the play-offs begin. I think Milwaukee is going to stay slightly under the top seeds in terms of positioning, while easily being on their level. Middleton seems to be having a down year, but if they somehow see Boston in the playoffs again then he'll turn back into Kobe for at least the time being. The Bucks are just as good as the teams above them, I just think they care less about seeding than those same teams.

**Miami Heat:** The East is tight. Miami being the fourth seed isn't a knock, I just think there will be very few games separating the top teams in the conference. I think Miami is going to be scarier in the playoffs than in the regular season with their roster construction. Once they go to an 8-9 man rotation they'll be cutting out those minutes from the players that have been holding them back thus far. Their bench is relatively weak outside of Herro, and what Morris and Oladipo look like once they come back.

**Cleveland Cavaliers:** Never would've expected them to sneak into a play-in game, let alone be fighting for homecourt for the playoffs. This team has tons of pieces and options, and they've been doing as well as they have with players missing extended time. This team has great depth, and I expect them to really give whoever they face a challenge this post season, while I don't necessarily think they advance having their top guys be so young. They could surprise someone though, they've already far exceeded expectations. I am a big fan of having Rondo and Love on their bench, and could easily see both having heavier minutes during the playoffs.

**Brooklyn Nets:** Kyrie still isn't playing every game, but either way this team with KD and Simmons both playing alongside the rest of their guys are going to be a top team. Their landslide caused a large enough issue to keep them from seeding too high, but nobody wants to face them in the playoffs. I think Ben is going to be a great fit with this squad, and is going to remind NBA fans how great he actually is. Look for Brooklyn to g et adjusted to the new additions but still move up slightly in the ranks.

**Charlotte Hornets:** I'm going under the assumption that Hayward isn't going to miss much more time. With Hayward playing, the Hornets are a very good team. They slide when he isn't there, and win regularly when he is. They have spiraled pretty badly as of recent while missing him, but I see them as better than each of the team below them in the standings here other than maybe Atlanta, but they have their own struggles to deal with. I expect one of the leagues best offenses to return once they are fully healthy again.

**Atlanta Hawks:** Collins should be returning once games resume this week, and when fully healthy this team is closer to a top team than how they've faired so far this season. They had a rough schedule to open the year as well as player availability problems, but I think they are going to continue off some of their more recent higher level play to close out the season much stronger.

**Toronto Raptors:** Toronto has been playing to their absolute best as of recent, but I'm not sure it is sustainable for the rest of the season. Their starters are good, but I don't see all of them playing at quite as high of a level as they have been all at the same time any longer. With that being said, their bench sucks. So if their starters aren't all playing at the absolute top of their capabilities then the team is going to struggle against most teams in the league. Thad was a good addition, but I don't like anyone else on their bench seeing the floor for very long.

**Boston Celtics:** Ready to get flamed yet again for a Boston take that isn't praising them. Boston is far exceeding their potential right now. They have had the easiest schedule imaginable since Christmas. They've played exclusively the worst teams in the league along with a few of the top teams that have been sitting their stars/starters for one reason or another. Their streak of good results has probably 2-3 actually good wins in it. Not trying to bash them, just with the context I don't believe any of this is sustainable. Tatum is still going to perform here and there with this roster construction when playing against good team's defenses, and the rest of the team just doesn't quite fit right. Derrick White was a great addition, but they gave up some of their limited depth to get him.

**New York Knicks:** The fall has been rough for New York. Randle has regressed, Kemba seems done, and the rest of the team is very inconsistent. Rose is coming back , which is great and can win them more games since he seems to always be a positive for them, but I think it's too late for them to pass up any of the team's competing for a play-in spot unless a team completely implodes or has a devastating injury.

**Washington Wizards:** With Beal being done this team isn't going to make any noise. Porzingis may play as an all-star, but they traded away some of their pieces and I don't see them fairing well without a lead ball handler. This team looks to be good in the future though with a decent point guard signing, so there's that to look forward to.

**Indiana Pacers:** What's new? Nothing with Indiana. The Pacers are stricken hard by injuries, and aren't even close to competing again this year because of it. Haliburton is a great addition and I like the future of this team (IF THEY CAN STAY HEALTHY), but they aren't doing much else this season.

**Detroit Pistons:** Not much to say, let's just keep seeing Cunningham, Bey, and Grant perform well and improve and this team can look forward to their future!

**Orlando Magic:** Orlando wasn't really competing to begin with, but injuries hit them anyway. They have a bright future with their pieces though. I like Anthony, Fultz, Wagner, Isaac, Okeke, Suggs... so this team is heading in the right direction, just needs time to develop. They should trade Ross obviously, guy could help a contender and they could get a decent pick back if a team was offering it (Next year of course).

&amp;#x200B;

**Western Conference:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1** Phoenix Suns

**2** Memphis Grizzlies

**3** Golden State Warriors

**4** Dallas Mavericks

**5** Utah Jazz

**6** Minnesota Timberwolves

**7** Denver Nuggets

**8** Los Angeles Lakers

**9** Los Angeles Clippers

**10** New Orleans Pelicans

**11** Sacramento Kings

**12** San Antonio Spurs

**13** Portland Blazers

**14** Oklahoma City Thunder

**15** Houston Rockets

&amp;#x200B;

**Phoenix Suns:** Sure they'll be missing CP3 for a month or two, but I clearly see them as the top team in the West, and they are a deep team, so I think they'll keep the edge over the next couple of teams that are somewhat close to them in the standings. This team is built incredibly well, and I'm a big fan of a lot of their role players and what they do in Phoenix. I also do believe Mikal Bridges may be the best 3&amp;D player in the league right now. I'm just not sure if Memphis or Golden State are going to surpass them, and surely no other team will.

**Memphis Grizzlies:** Another one of those teams that has vastly surprised me this season. I did not see Bane becoming the player he has turned out to be, and Ja has also improved more than I believed. One of the biggest reasons for their success though, in my opinion, is their depth. While every team has struggled with injuries and COVID protocols, Memphis has better talent at their bottom end than most teams in the league, so when they have players miss time they still get quality minutes on the court while others are struggling during those stretches.

**Golden State Warriors:** If Steph picks it back up they can easily pass up Memphis, but if not I think they'll hang in the same spot maybe slightly below. Klay has pleasantly surprised me, I thought it would take a bit longer for him to see as many minutes as he is, although his production is close to where I thought it would be. I think come playoff time it's going to be mostly dependent on Curry to beat other team, but this team has a high floor, so I think they handle business during the rest of the season for the most part.

**Dallas Mavericks:** I hate that the Luka &amp; KP duo never got a fair shot atit, but it is what it is. Luka started off kinda rough this year, and Dallas stayed decently good throughout that, but as of late he has started playing like the MVP contender he is again, and unless he drops off for some reason again I see them racking up wins. They don't have a solidified number 2, but they are deep with talent through every playable position to make up for it. I'm expecting Kleber to pick it up for the rest of the season with Porzingis being gone.

**Utah Jazz:** The Jazz ae hard one to place for me. On one hand I don't see many weaknesses in their roster, but on the other hand something just seems off about them going forward. I like the addition of House, and am iffy on NAW, but he has potential so we'll have to see how he fits in Utah. I see them as playing about at the same level they have been so far, just getting passed up by Dallas.

**Minnesota Timberwolves:** Happy to see Minnesota plying well, and with their bench outperforming my expectations I don't see them having trouble finishing above any teams below here other than maybe Denver or a surging Lakers team. Ant has a small injury he's dealing with, but luckily for T'Wolves fans it seem that KAT and D'Lo currently matter more to winning games. I really like the fit of most of their bench unit as well considering the improvements a few have made. Special shout out to Vanderbilt, never would have guessed he'd be as integral to the teams success as he's been so far.

**Denver Nuggets:** I'm not surprised that Denver has continued to play well without 2 of their top 3 players, because Jokic is just that good, and the supporting cast is great as well. I do see them sliding slightly down as long as the teams above them don't face any more injury issues. If Denver were seeded a few spots higher I'd seriously ave Jokic competing with Embiid and Giannis for the MVP, but standing where they are I don't think he has a chance.

**Los Angeles Lakers:** Yea, people think Westbrook sucks. People think all of the role players suck. AD is missing some more time.. but it doesn't really matter. I think LeBron is about to get very very serious and not let the Lakers stay outside of the top 8. Westbrook has some real low games, but for the most part he's been a top 3 player for the Lakers overall this season. He's vastly popular to hate, but it's easy to ignore the good games he has or the bad play from other Laker players too. I hope Nunn can come back, because I truly think he can help a good bit. I'd also like to see more Dwight minutes on the bench, I haven't been a fan of him not getting much time on the court.

**Los Angeles Clippers:** Without their stars, and now Powell I don't see the good fortunes of the Clippers being sustainable. They've kept pulling off good close wins, but they have to fall back to earth eventually. I don't see them playing badly or anything, just not at the level of anyone above them, or even maybe a couple teams around them that had early season struggles.

**New Orleans Pelicans:** If Zion comes back this team can be very scary.. If not then they are just a decent team that can maybe sneak into the 8th seed. I like the roster changes they've made, and they are not a team to sleep on, but they still need Zion to scare any team above them in a playoff series. That being said, I think they are clearly better than the teams fighting for the last play-in spot like Sacramento, Portland or San Antonio.

**Sacramento Kings:** After the trade I think the Kings have more cohesion, but I don't think it pushes them very far from where they were before. Either Fox or Sabonis needs to take a step for this team to turn into a playoff contender or for their other pieces to improve rapidly. The future looks better, but it just isn't their time yet.

**San Antonio Spurs:** San Antonio retooled for the future and I like the direction they are moving in. With that being said they are decent enough to compete on most nights, but not quite enough to pull out wins against much better teams. The Kings, Spurs, and Blazers are all going to finish in basically the same spot in my eyes.

**Portland Blazers:** Dame is in no rush to come back, and considering the moves the team made I don't see him coming back this season unless he just wants some reps in at the end of the year. Simons has been filling in nicely, but I don't see him as someone to consistently perform at this level, especially not against the better defenses on a regular basis. I think overall the team's roster is slightly worse than it was, but the fits seem better, so they'll probably perform similarly in the future imo.

**Oklahoma City Thunder:** The SGA, Giddey, Dort trio is fun and seems great for the future, but other than that the team is very bad. I'm surprised they've pulled off some of the wins that they have, but SGA being out has sealed the ide of winning almost any games. They are fighting the Rockets for 15th seed in the west.

**Houston Rockets:** It hurts to type my favorite team being this far down, but let's face reality. We have an exciting young core, even if the development has not come quite as expected. I sure would've liked Green to not miss time and also start the season not playing alongside two bigs logjammed together. I also wish Sengun got more time on the court, some being his own fault, some not being his fault. Love EG, hopefully he either stays long term on a shorter deal at some point, or we trade him to a contender for a good return (He's worth it). KPJ and Wood both have some issues, but I think both would heavily benefit from not playing on one of the worst teams in the league and losing regularly. I do like their games long term and hope they both stay around.",1,47,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

**WOULDN'T**

Boston Celtics - They have a young core and I have a feeling LeBron in Boston wouldn't go over very well

Cleveland Cavaliers - I hope Cavs don't trade what they've built on their own for LeBron. First time since way before LeBron they're relevant without him. 

Charlotte Hornets - I think they're just young enough to consider not trading for him and risking their future. Also MJ, IDK if he'd want LeBron on his team.

Detroit Pistons - They're not contending for the next few years and need to build around the MotorCade

Houston Rockets - Rockets are doing basketball things, not winning, but other basketball things

Indiana Pacers - They won't pay a lot when they can just wait till Kings draft another future All-Star and just rob them of that player

Los Angeles Clippers - I just don't see the Clippers having enough assets to get him honestly 

Memphis Grizzlies - They got a top 3 young core and shouldn't give anything up

Milwaukee Bucks - They have their team and they're gonna run with them

Oklahoma City Thunder - I don't think the Lakers would send the 2027 pick with LeBron so Presti is out

Orlando Magic - They're focusing on their youngins and don't want an Anakin situation where LeBron comes in and takes them out

Phoenix Suns - I don't think I need to explain this one 

San Antonio Spurs - Pop trading with the Lakers. LMAO

&amp;#x200B;

**WOULD** 

Atlanta Hawks - They'd give up anyone besides Trae

Brooklyn Nets - Besides KD I'm sure they would trade anyone in order to pair 2 of the top 5 players in the league right now

Chicago Bulls - With Lavine on Contract year, I could see the Bulls making a move to give them a stronger case at a championship next year

Dallas Mavericks - Who knows if Cuban has this hate for LeBron he might not trade for him at all. But LeBron and Luka together seem like they could make anyone into a serviceable NBA role player

Denver Nuggets - Same as Mavericks, except the Cuban part. So maybe a stronger case here

Golden State Warriors - LMAO League fucked once again by the Warriors

Miami Heat - Reunion? I could see the Heat giving away a healthy amount to bring him back

Minnesota Timberwolves - Besides Ant and KAT, I'm sure the Wolves would give up a lot at one shot at a title. 

New Orleans Pelicans - Goodbye Zion? Maybe the one trade where the Lakers would send out more than they receive

New York Knicks - LeBron playing 48 mpg under Thibs

Philadelphia 76ers - Embiid, Harden, and LBJ. How could you not trade anyone else in order to form this big 3

Portland Trail Blazers - They want help for Dame, this is said help

3053,56,r/NBA user editorial: How the Goat became second.,"Excuse the title Im practicing a future in title writing. But here's a writing I've been planning, my take on How Lebron James the best player in my opinion became second. 

Here's my take on Jordan vs Lebron I'm a Bron superman I guess. Honestly I think Lebron is better at the game of basketball. LeBron understand the game and all the positions (mini games; ie screens, switches etc), he can win more games than anyone else solo. LeBron is just better than anyone else at the game of basketball. Jordan is a better basketball player though, Jordan was so good he was making his own games to compete. His skill was unmatched he did things to make it harder for himself. No one matched Jordan, his sauce swag, guys are still trying to be great at the game he was exceptional. 

LeBron is the closest in that individual greatness and his team greatness is better. However here's why Lebron is number 2....after beating the pistons in 07 with 45, Lebron averaged 22 in the finals. After killing the east in 2011 and for past few years Lebron averaged 17. 

LeBron prior has had some of the greatest games and series just like Jordan, however the difference is Jordan had not much expectations and all the rewards. LeBron had all the expectations and not much reward. When Bron dropped 45 to get to the finals commentators said it was Jordanesqe, everything he did was scrutinized be Jordan.

I want to add a disclaimer for decision because I think he mental had a breakdown due to stress from the backlash. Regardless, 2x in a row to showcase his greatness he laid an egg. 2014 LeBron shot 57% but only averaged 27... disgraceful. He averaged 36 next year with a bad back....He has never gone all out in the finals. We've seen what he can do.

LeBron should be Goat and he's the best we've seen of Individual and team contributed greatness however he's gotten in his way. If Bron averaged 30+ and 35 even on bad efficient and was 4&amp;6 he'd be Goat. But MJ always went out. Even Giannis dropped 50 his first finals to close out. LeBron took till 2018 to drop 50 (In OT) he choked in that too.

I'm a hugeeeee Bron fan. But these are facts and he should still be appreciated.",1,49,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

(After kareems last MVP)

•don’t include any of the pistons teams cuz I’m pretty sure the best player of the 1989, 1990 and 2004 pistons is the answer to this question",1,70,14,0.4588,0.193,0.472,0.335
3055,58,"[Scotto] When I look at the next tier of free agents, Deandre Ayton may have to get an offer sheet from another team like Detroit or San Antonio. We’ve seen how Phoenix was hesitant to give him a max contract","&gt;Certainly, there were tensions behind the scenes when Ayton didn’t get that this offseason. I think that push comes to shove, he’s going to have to get that money elsewhere, at least that full max.

&gt;When it comes to the Charlotte Hornets and Miles Bridges, Charlotte wasn’t trying to extend him before the season when it was around the $20 million annual range. Now, he’s going to command more than that on the market most people think around the league.

&gt;Gozlan: For both guys, if they wanted to pursue max offer sheets, it’s about a projected $130 million over four years. Offer sheets have definitely become a lot less common over the past few years. A lot of restricted free agency has been settled with sign-and-trades if movement needs to happen. The last offer sheet we got was Bogdan Bogdanovic to Atlanta in 2020.

&gt;Scotto: ​​What’s going to be interesting is Jalen Brunson’s free agency. A lot of people going into the trade deadline thought Dallas was going to have a tough time keeping both Brunson and Dorian Finney-Smith with the looming luxury tax concerns. Finney-Smith has extended his contract in Dallas. Brunson is the top point guard who could potentially change teams this offseason. On our last HoopsHype podcast episode, I touched on how there’s a lot of smoke whether the Knicks have true interest in Brunson or if those rumors are based on the CAA relationship ties he has with Leon Rose, who represented his dad, Rick Brunson. The Knicks could use a point guard upgrade, and Brunson’s still young enough, where he fits with that core if the Knicks chose to go that route. Dallas will have to decide if they can match his market value with the luxury tax looming and maybe trade Spencer Dinwiddie, or sign-and-trade Brunson, if he breaks the bank.

&gt;Anfernee Simons will be a restricted free agent for the Portland Trail Blazers. Most people around the league think Simons will be retained by the Blazers.

&gt;After Simons, you’ve got Collin Sexton on our free agent list. You can make a case that he’s a wild card and can maybe get a prove it short-term type of deal compared to what he originally thought. When he was in extension talks with Cleveland, they were talking, depending on what side you ask for their perspective, big money. They were talking $20 million-ish or more (annually), as one side wanted. That didn’t get done. He got hurt, unfortunately, and he’ll be the biggest wild card this summer when it comes to free agency. I’ve touched on Cleveland wanting to retain him.

&gt;A couple of other guys stick out to me a little bit. Bobby Portis, who passed on some money previously to stay with the Milwaukee Bucks. He kind of surprised people when he did. Montrezl Harrell with the Hornets. They had their concerns with paying Miles Bridges previously. They’re now going to have to pay Harrell, too, if they want to keep him. The guy who’s boosted his value as much as anyone not named Anfernee Simons is Malik Monk on the Lakers. You can make a case for Jalen Brunson too.

&gt;Gozlan: There’s a way Charlotte can fit Harrell and a new contract for Bridges. If Bridges gets something in the $20-25 million range, they can still bring back Montrezl at around what he’s making. It would probably be between the full mid-level exception without avoiding the tax. Portis and Monk have some interesting similarities. Portis took a discount to stay with the Bucks in the past offseason. Part of it was probably with the possibility of earning more this offseason once he gains Early Bird rights. It would allow him to re-sign with the Bucks for a little more than the full mid-level exception… I’d imagine Monk would like to stay there (Los Angeles), if possible. They’re limited to offering him the taxpayer mid-level exception this offseason. If he accepts that, then maybe they do a one-plus-one deal where they can re-sign him with Early Bird rights next offseason. I think he can get an offer for the full mid-level exception of about four years and $44 million. A lot of teams have that to offer, and there’s not a lot of cap space out there.

Some points on the lists:

\- Jordan, LeBron, Kareem, and Bird were ranked in the same place on all lists - 1, 2, 3, 7 respectively. 

\- Duncan and Kobe were each ranked higher than the other in two lists each.

\- Shaq and Kobe were each ranked higher than the other in two lists each.

\- Mikan, Rick, and Harden only appear on one list each. 

\- Biggest variance is Giannis who's 11 spots higher on one list compared to another.

\- The two Malones have the same rank.

\- 7 current players.

\- Decade with the most top 30 players in their prime: 90s and 2000s (7 each), 2010s (6), 60s and 80s (5 each)

&amp;#x200B;

Some thoughts:

\- Dirk and Moses should be higher than KG

\- Hakeem and Curry should be higher than Oscar

\- Bird, Shaq, and Kobe should be higher than both Russel and Wilt

\- Moses should be higher than Dr. J

\- Giannis and Durant seem perfectly ranked

\- Barkley should be higher than Karl

3095,98,The Zion Williamson Situation and the Upcoming CBA Renegotiations,"So this whole Zion situation going on in New Orleans is obviously going to be brought up in the future negotiations in the new CBA. Small market teams can mostly build through the draft and hope they're able to find a generational talent. 

When your player than hasn't played a full season worth of games in 3 years has mentally/physically checked out from the organization, and has family wanting to force a trade to a large market team, you as a small market team are going to make sure the new CBA does something about young players wanting to force trades early. I believe this is going to be a point of contention between owners and players which will eventually lead to a lockdown. 

So my question to y'all is, if you're a small market team, what kind of demands are you asking for the upcoming CBA renewal? Longer rookie contracts? Even more money/longer terms on rookie extensions? Or a more radical approach? For example, I had an idea, a stupid one I must admit, but what if players still on their rookie deal who are disinterested in playing/ trying to force a trade by their actions are just dropped from the league completely for 3 years or something. Meaning if you try to force a trade while on a rookie deal/extension, a team can drop you/ contract is null&amp;void and no other team in the NBA/Gleague can sign you for 2-3 years.

Is his contract garbage? yes

Is he stubborn as fuck about how he plays? yes

Despite some of his rebounds being padded, he is still one of the best rebounding point guards ever

His MVP season was still a massive job considering the roster. A team with rookie Sabonis (who was bad), 2016-17 Oladipo (who was meh) and Andre roberson as your best players should not be winning 45 games/

3115,18,[OC] Too Many Ads! An analysis on how the NBA is making its product more ugly.,"#TL;DR With comparison picture at the bottom

As NBA fans, I think we can all agree that the NBA has gotten a bit liberal with ad breaks. But in the past couple of years I’ve noticed that they’ve let anyone with a paycheck put their logo on the tv screen, and its gotten a bit out of hand.

Lets see how many ads the NBA allows DURING THE GAME. This does not include ad breaks for television. This is simply how many ads are present on your screen as you watch THE GAME.

More recently, the NBA has started putting ads on the SIDELINE and even DIGITAL ADS. Shit started to go south during the bubble.

[Bubble ads](https://imgur.com/a/Dw2ac0F)

Starting off with the most obvious ones, the on court. Courts usually have their arena name, which is technically an ad (companies are paying to put their logo on the court). These have been around for a while, but its still (+1)

[Mid court Ads](https://imgur.com/a/V6mEWNh)

From a mid-court perspective, we have:

* The arena name
* Digital ad 1
* Digital ad 2
* Screen
* Sideline


Lets take a look at the baseline

[Baseline ads](https://imgur.com/a/lvlkgBn)

The baseline is where the nba starts to go crazy.
Available space includes:

* Side panels
* Baseline on the court

And now we get into the bullshit. The hoop. The NBA decided to stuff more shit on the hoop more than Zion does at a buffet. Lets take a look at this example here:

[Hoop ads](https://imgur.com/a/beJmJU9)


In this example, we can see:

* Ad on front panel of hoop (Sonic)
* Ad on bottom side of the hoop (Horseshoe)
* Ad on side padding of Hoop (fanduel)
* Ad printed on metal arm (Spalding)
* Digital Ad board
* Ad on hoop arm padding (Statefarm)
* Ad on the shotclock

And if that wasn’t enough, there’s even an ad on the 

* TOP OF THE BACKBOARD

[Top of the backboard](https://imgur.com/a/PJicYn8)

Not to mention some arenas even have ads 

* on panels behind the hoop as well. 

Take a look at the LG panels in the Raptors stadium. (which also can stuff more ads on the cloth panels in the stands, but we won’t count those for now)

[Panels behind the hoop](https://imgur.com/a/oShNRUJ)

On top of all of this bullshit, some teams will also put 

* on screen ads during the game 

so count those, and the universally-loved 

* jersey ads as well.

Thats a total of at LEAST 18 ads WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING THE GAME. And there’s probably a shit ton more due to digital ads and electronic ad boards, or stuff I’ve missed.


#As a comparison, [HERES WHAT THE COURT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE THE BUBBLE.](https://imgur.com/a/LNe5RrH)


 Nice and clean. Sure there were still ads snuck in, but the clean court/sidelines/baselines really shows you the difference on how low the NBA has stooped.

A lot of the ads depend on the network/arena, but as time goes on, more and more teams are choosing to give in for a quick buck.

So what’s the point of this post? Obviously the NBA won’t stop their million dollar deals to remove ads, but honestly the product is noticeably worse, and the NBA is becoming one of the ugliest sports to LOOK at.

3129,32,"Harden + Kyrie + Durant Were the Ultimate ""All This Just to Beat ______"" Trio","**Introduction**

The phrase ""All This Just to Beat _____"" has been used a lot over the years. However, I think it has never been more true than with this specific trio of players. This post was inspired by u/burner_for_celtics for a comment he made in the r/bostonceltics subreddit.

**All This**

""All This"" refers to the talent/what is required to complete the task stated in the second half of the phrase. The talent of this trio is unquestionable: 

1. Kevin Durant: Top 15 player All-Time imo

2. James Harden: MVP level player still in his prime when the team was assembled. Led one of the best non title teams in NBA history.

3. Kyrie Irving: Arguably the best offensive weapon as a 3rd option in NbA history. Clutch shooting NBA Champion with handles, high efficiency, 3rd eye, and genius beyond compare. AND he only got better with this core.

**Just to Beat the Celtics**

""Just to Beat"" is used to refer how minimal the task is compared to what is required to complete that task. In this case, the task was beating the Celtics. In their time together, this is essentially what the core accomplished and mostly what they were used for. Here is a fun, (or not so fun if you are a Celtics fan), minutes breakdown:

- Harden + Durant + Kyrie played a grand total of 365 minutes together (regular season + playoffs)

- Harden + Durant + Kyrie played 130 minutes of that time together against the Boston Celtics in the first round of playoffs

- That's 36% of their total time together for one team in one playoff series

**Conclusion**

Harden + Kyrie + Durant: All that just to beat the 2020-2021 Boston Celtics, a .500 team that was missing Jaylen Brown, had an injured Kemba, and an Evan Fournier who hadn't adjusted yet.

Put another way:

3154,57,Fun facts about the Pacers!,"Every now and then I pull these facts out during draft discussions and they're wonky enough to have their own post. 

You've probably heard that the Pacers don't tank. I'm so glad we're finally embracing it this year - we're really going against the grain of what we've done in the past. 

___________

The last time we had a pick greater than #10 was in **1989** when we drafted George McCloud at #7. **Let me repeat, the Pacers have not had a pick higher than #10 in OVER THREE DECADES**. 

___________

The Pacers have never had a #1 pick! Our highest picks ever were #2 in 1985 (Wayman Tisdale) and 1988 (Rik Smits). Not bad picks by any means, but neither were franchise-defining talents. 

___________

The highest pick we've had recently was #10 in 2010 with Paul George. Obviously a great pick and we're still seeing the effects of the PG trade in 2022. Let's examine that trade chain:

Paul George was traded to the Thunder in 2017 in exchange for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. 

Oladipo had an incredible first season in Indiana, but ended up tanking his value for a variety of reasons. Amazingly, we got to swap him for Caris LeVert, who was then swapped at this year's trade deadline for Ricky Rubio's expiring, a 2022 Cleveland first and a 2022 Houston second (which is almost a first round pick with how high it'll be). 

Sabonis blossomed into a 2-time All-Star under the Pacers and the Pacers shocked the NBA with a trade to the Kings. Sabonis, Justin Holiday and Jeremy Lamb were swapped with Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson. Thompson was recently waived by the Pacers.

**TLDR: We traded Paul George for Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and two first round picks.**

___________

Finally, here's a relatively known fact - the Pacers drafted Kawhi Leonard with the 15th pick in the 2011 draft but we traded him on draft night to the Spurs for George Hill (*whoosh*). 

What's not well know about that Leonard trade though is that we also included the draft rights to Davis Bertans in that trade. He was picked 42nd by the Pacers in the 2011 draft, but he wouldn't play in the NBA until 2016.",1,27,5,0.5562,0.0,0.527,0.473

3157,60,[OC] The NBA's Newest and Most Confusing Young Duo: The Fox and the Ox,"When the Sacramento Kings traded Tyrese Haliburton to the Indiana Pacers, the NBA community let out a collective gasp. But there is a silver lining. It opened up opportunities for the two other young point guards on the Kings, Davion Mitchell and De’Aaron Fox. Davion Mitchell has had a promising rookie season, but Fox is the true star. Last season, Fox averaged 25.2 points, 7.5 assists, and 1.5 steals. He is having a down season this year, but many people blame a crowded backfield with more point guards than the team knows how to deal with. They thought that by clearing up their logjam at point guard, Fox would find his role once again and flourish.  Early returns look very promising. De’Aaron is averaging 28 points per game since Haliburton was traded, up significantly from 21.8 on the season. But as with any trade, the players who left the Kings were only half the story.

    Domantas Sabonis is 25 years old. He is already a two-time all-star, a high level scorer and passer, and one of the very best screeners in the world. If you want a big man to build your offense around, he is very close to the prototype. There are just two problems. He can’t shoot and he can’t play defense. Turns out those are pretty tough problems to overcome in the modern NBA. So despite all the individual success in Sabonis young career, an important question has followed him around. Can he lead a championship level team despite his flaws? The Kings are putting serious money on a bet that he can. The Lithuanian big man has floated around 20 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists over his last few seasons but that statistical success has not led to anything once the playoffs roll around. Supporters of his would say that is more to do with his previous organization’s unwillingness to commit to building around him and his skill set. Detractors will say that he is simply not good enough. The Kings are far from a franchise known for their ability to build a winning team, but they are clearly willing to build around Sabonis, and that is more than you can say for any of his previous teams. So the question arises. How far can Domantas and De’Aaron go?  


In their final game before the All-Star break, the Kings faced off against the Bulls and DeMar DeRozan. They lost by seven but kept it competitive against a good team for a full 48 minutes. And over those 48 minutes, we got the full Fox and Ox experience. The duo of stars had their flaws on full display, but they also had moments of subtle (and not so subtle) brilliance. On this play, Fox weaves side to side, forcing his defender to dodge Sabonis again and again until he finally ends up caught out of position and Fox takes advantage.

*Processing video tzaksomuzkj81...*

    On this possession, Sabonis’s screen sets Ayo Dosunmu behind the play and after a great fox pass and a tough Sabonis catch, Sabonis has an open layup and two points.

*Processing video tvgir9xvzkj81...*

    Here, Dosunmu is so worried about staying ahead of the play despite the Sabonis screen that he jumps the gun and leaves Fox wide open from three point range. [https://go.nba.com/nz99r](https://go.nba.com/nz99r) 

It happens again on this play, where the threat of a screen forces the defender to be aggressive and move out of position, allowing Fox to blow by him and get the layup. [https://go.nba.com/i73a7](https://go.nba.com/i73a7) 

    Even the idea of a Sabonis screen gives openings for Fox and the rest of the Kings. Sabonis is also often used as a screener off ball to open up players for catch and shoot opportunities off of Fox’s passes. It's a subtle skill you won't notice in the flow of a game, but when you look closely, Sabonis is always in the exact right place to give the shooter the maximum amount of space to get off their shot. These three plays show that ability off to a T. 

*Processing video gpmoqd610lj81...*

The Kings now also have multiple players who can each be the center of the offense, meaning that if one needs to take a rest the other can take over for a few minutes without a major drop off in the quality of the offense. Not only that, but the stylistic dichotomy of the two players allows the team to dramatically change the team's style with one substitution. Even when they share the court, some possessions feel like 'Ox' possessions. Some of that is unfamiliarity. The two have not played together for long, it would be unreasonable of Sabonis to have completely integrated into the offensive style of the Kings. But even as the star builds chemistry with the team, there is something to be said for having the occasional possession completely built on the skill set of Sabonis. Every team has a plan for dealing with the pick and roll, and the good teams execute it well. But not all teams are prepared to deal with an elite post playmaker and scorer in the modern NBA. Say what you want about Sabonis, it's hard to argue his skill set isn't unique these days. Especially when the playoffs come around and you are game-planning for one opponent, offensive flexibility is massively important. The Kings have it in spades with Sabonis.

        During these 'Ox' possessions, we see a variety of shooters and perimeter playmakers circling the three-point line while Sabonis goes to work with post moves and handoffs. It's a simple offense in theory but one that only works with an elite playmaker to put in the middle. Sabonis is that elite playmaker. He always makes the right read, and he is a master of manipulating the defense from the post. He fakes the shot to open up the pass, he fakes the pass to open up the shot, and he does everything in between. In these three possessions he picks apart the defense from the post in three different ways. First, he draws multiple help defenders and quickly fires a pass over to Harrison Barnes, who knocks down the wide open shot. Later, Sabonis grabs the offensive rebound and finds an open cutter for the dunk while doubled in the post. And finally, in his pièce de résistance, Sabonis outmaneuvers three defenders swarming him in the post with constant movement, an incredible pass fake and finally, a tough finish through contact. Doesn't get much better than that.

*Processing video yfmiwfm20lj81...*

  De'Aaron Fox has never been the type of player to take control of halfcourt offense in the same way Sabonis does, but he doesn't have to be one. Instead, Fox shines most as a player in transition, where he can use his speed, shiftiness, and split second decision making to pick apart vulnerable teams trying to rush back and set up their defense. On these plays, Fox quickly analyzes the defense and makes the right read to get good opportunities at the rim.

*Processing video c85vq9240lj81...*

For all of those reasons and more, this young duo has a lot of potential, especially on the offensive end. But as is always the case with unrealized potential, they have a lot of issues to deal with before they are anything resembling a duo good enough to power a contending team. Unfortunately for the Kings, basketball is only 50% defense. Despite Fox's nickname ""Swipa'' being a joke about his ability to steal the ball, he lacks effort on defense, often finds himself out of position, gets beaten off the dribble regularly, and is just generally bad. Some of those problems can be fixed quickly. If he stayed engaged and focused on defense, he would undoubtedly be a better defender off-ball. As an on-ball defender, Fox is a high risk high reward type of player. Sometimes he will get killed by a skilled opponent, sometimes he will poke the ball away for free possession. That's not always great, but it's also not inherently a problem. The issue arises when the reward comes less and less often. Fox is averaging less steals than he has since his rookie season, when he was averaging almost 8 minutes less per game. Fox has taken a step back in that aspect of his game, and he hasn't made up for it in other areas on defense. He needs to return to the 'Swipa' we all know and love, and he has to do it while improving his effort, focus, and awareness. Once he does that, this team will look completely different on that end of the court. An elite defensive point guard who can pressure ball handlers everywhere across the court is extremely valuable, and along with Davion Mitchell, the Kings could have two.

    Sabonis's defensive issues are even more concerning. Fox's are bad, but they are also fixable. Sabonis needs to improve his habits on defense, he often makes unforced errors that put him out of position. Those can be remedied. He is also slow, unathletic, and generally lacking in all of the attributes we attach to being an elite defensive big man. That cannot be fixed, and because of that, he will never be a great defender. The question is whether or not he can even be average. The issue isn't just that Sabonis isn't the athlete players like Robert Williams or Bam Adebayo are, almost nobody is. That in itself is fine. But Sabonis plays like he thinks he are as athletic as them. Williams and Adebayo often purposely put themselves between two threats, knowing their instincts and athleticism can close the distance and stop either. Sabonis tries the same thing but stops neither. This play is a perfect example. Sabonis can't decide whether or not to commit to a driving Dosunmu so instead he stands paralyzed under the rim as the rookie easily converts the layup. [https://go.nba.com/5kpnh](https://go.nba.com/5kpnh)

He also has a habit of losing his man open for no apparent reason like he does on this play, in which he gifts Nikola Vucevic a wide open three pointer: [https://go.nba.com/fxcw0](https://go.nba.com/fxcw0) 

His last major issue defensively is over-helping. He tends to aggressively help on ball-handlers when it is counterproductive, and it often leads to the rest of the defense breaking down in order to make up for him. On this play, Sabonis foolishly leaves his man, leading to him being beaten off the dribble and giving up a dunk. [https://go.nba.com/xu4uv](https://go.nba.com/xu4uv)

    In many ways, Fox and Sabonis are two sides of the same coin. Both are promising offensive talents who provide serious value through scoring and playmaking despite some flaws. Both have flawed defensive habits that need breaking. Both make foolish mistakes despite clearly knowing the game inside and out. The Kings made a gamble. Tyrese Haliburton is about as much of a sure thing as any young player in the league. Based on what he's shown off thus far, he will at worst be a high level starter in the league over his Pacers career. With Sabonis or Fox there is no such promise. Either could fail to fix their bad habits, develop a few more, and before you know it both will be cautionary tales for talented young players with defensive issues. But if things end up flipping the other way and the pair can resolve their issues while adding to their lists of strengths, this team could make some noise over the next few years. In this league the hardest thing to find are offensive engines, players who can get open shots for himself and the people around him. The Kings have two of them. This trade has largely been viewed as a disaster for the Kings, and if this duo doesn't pan out we could look back at it that way. But if Fox and Sabonis can reach their potential as a duo on both ends of the court, the league better watch out.

3171,74,Best Player Every 10 Years.,"The goat debate has gotten out of control since the all-star game and I’m wondering how everyone feels about breaking it down by sections of 10 years: 

1960s: Bill Russell 

1970s: Kareem Abdul-Jabar

1980s: Larry Bird 

1990s: Michael Jordan 

2000s: Kobe Bryant 

2010s: Lebron James

Would anyone disagree with this? The arguments I can see is Wilt for the 60s, Magic for the 80s, or Duncan for the 2000s. 

I’m just curious if the consensus would lean closer to this because I think this is a better way to view these things rather than “GOAT” since that’s always the same 3 arguments about the same 2-3 people.",1,27,5,0.6369,0.0,0.488,0.512

And while they were ranked 18th in FG%, they were among the best defensive teams, giving up 44.6% and ranking 5th in the league. There offensive and defensive ratings were 108.8 and 103.7, good for 11th and 4th in the league respectively.

How would these Lakers fit into today's game? Would they still be one of the best teams in the league? Where would Kobe rank among the best players in the league right now?

3184,87,"The Manu Ginobili debate: How do players like Vince Carter, T-Mac, and Damian Lillard compare?","TL;DR: Manu's team success and individual success in the few seasons he was a starter leaves questions about what he could have been. Is he past players like VC, T-Mac, and Dame Time?

&amp;nbsp;

When it comes to comparing players across eras, a balance must be struck between the success of a team and individual success. While I don't think it's fair to compare winning across players with different roles, I also don't think it's fair to compare statistical achievements of players with different roles. 

&amp;nbsp;

The other post had me thinking more about Manu. Most of Manu's prime was sacrificed due to injuries or leading the 6th man unit of the Spurs, hampering any statistical accolades / success. He also served as the 2 A / B behind a top-10 player all-time. Manu's two All-Star years came when he was starting and in 2011, he even got selected as All-NBA 3rd team at the ripe old age of 34, starting the most games he ever had. Advanced stats love him as an efficient option who was a strong defender, and he most certainly passed every eye-test from those who watched him. 

&amp;nbsp;

Had Manu left the Spurs in his prime to lead his own team, it's very possible he could have had success (just look at 2004 Athens). An idea I think about is the following: imagine if Harden had stayed with the Thunder. He'd win a few more 6th Man of the Years and maybe the Thunder win a few rings in the process. He stays loyal and earns a few All-Star team nods in down years, rarely enters the debate of MVP, but remains a beloved what-if story. Would we be talking about him like Manu?

&amp;nbsp;

So when it comes to a debate about stars who have led their own teams to minimal playoff success, without a major co-star, how should they be compared? Lillard has been considered a top-5 player and top-2 PG constantly through the mid to latter half of his career. Yet a lot of his statistical success came after the departure of LaMarcus Aldridge and his postseason resume is sparse with only one WCF run. Vince Carter was a superstar by all accounts who revived the dunk contest and the city of Toronto. But injuries, a lack of postseason success, and a massive ego contributed to a mediocre team success career. T-Mac left Vince to lead a team in Houston and was a star, a clear top-5 player at times! But continuous blown playoff series and guess what, more injuries, led to a shortened career. Would Manu have been in the same boat? And would that have been better for his career standing overall?

While most seem to think it could have a future in the sport, many are also cautious about adopting it full time. 

A real pathway to including it I think the NBA should consider is adopting it as a sudden-death style overtime. This keeps the 48 minutes of regulation gameplay exactly the same, but if both teams are tied after 4 quarters, the game would then be won by the first team to score (let’s say) 12 points. This would make for a definitive and exciting ending, and almost entirely eliminate intentional fouls in the extra period. Yes, this would sacrifice double and triple OT games, but for real, those games can be pretty brutal on the players and also pretty brutal to watch in some instances.

Every city in the league has at least 1 Cheesecake Factory. There is a clear correlation between cities that have a lot of Cheesecake Factories and get a lot of free agents. Therefore, having an easier time constructing rosters.

&amp;#x200B;

|*NBA Cities with more than 3 Cheesecake factories* | *NBA Cities with 1 or 2 Cheesecake factories* |

| 21 - LA, 17 - NYC, 13 - DC, 8 - Boston, Miami, 6 - Chicago, 5- Atlanta, Phoenix, 4 - Philly, San Francisco, Houston, 3 - Orlando, Denver, Dallas |  With 2: Cleveland, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Portland, San Antonio                 With 1: Toronto, Detroit, Charlotte, OKC, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Memphis, New Orleans |

Thus, if the NBA needs an even clearer reason for Seattle and Vegas, just look at how they compare to other expansion candidates for number of Cheesecake Factories. The next expansion city cannot be one without the league’s favorite place to dine. Any expansion city would be smart to try and obtain a franchise if they do not already have one.

As a temporary Clippers fan, I think i would actually say the Suns here - even if they’re fully healthy.

- Then you get rid of Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier

Of course you have Cam Reddish so use him.

In reality Shaq was forced into the high post by Rasheed and Ben Wallace he didn't get into position and he didn't get his easy looks at the rim and when he did get the ball he was sloppy with it he averaged 3 turnovers a game including 6 in game 1 and on defense he didn't seem to care, he averaged 4.4 fouls in the series and only got 4 blocks the series. He had 1 great game game 4 he put up 36-20 outside of game 4 he averaged 24/8 including 14/8 in game 3 


Shaq had a good series but not a great one 


Kobe didn't shoot them out of the series 

Kobe took the most shots on the team that's true he shot 22 more than Shaq 

Kobe wasn't shooting over double teams or triple teams he was being pressured everytime he got the ball and would often get open looks for Gary Payton and devean George neither player had good series but they were missing easy looks.  It's easy to say he should have dumped it to Shaq every play but Ben Wallace forced him out of the paint and Denied entry passes while she'd and prince shagged on George and Malone clogging the passing lanes,  Malone was hurt and shot 33%in the series. 

Alot of Kobe misses were late in the clock and he didn't get set. Kobe was the primary ball handler and led the team in scoring all season and playoffs so he was taking alpt of bail out shots 


We need to stop placing blame for why they lost and appreciate what Detroit did Detroit caused issues for both Kobe and Shaq

They have two FRPs and Talen Horton-Turnover which at best case they could maybe use one of those picks to get rid of Westbrook and package THT and the other one for some average player. That's not going to cut it.

He wasn't putting pressure on the Lakers with these comments - he was straight up saying that they suck and he's gone. Obviously there is blame to go around everywhere for the shit show that the Lakers have become, but that doesn't make it so LeBron just can't bounce.

LeBron has made it clear that he wants to keep winning and will not just chill and retire in LA. He's considered by most to be at worst the 2nd best player of all time and he's 37 and at the end of his career. He has one more year left on his contract after this year. For all of these reasons - if he wants out - the Lakers will have to trade him to wherever he chooses for basically matching salary and a FRP in return. The Lakers wouldn't want the optics of keeping a GOAT hostage in the twilight years of his career and another team won't have to give up a kings ransom in return since he's 37 with one year remaining on his contract. 

I just think we need to pepper our angus for the hardest road 2.0. He's been buddying up to Steph the last few years and has made comments about how he would love to play with Steph. He's friends and has the Klutch connection with Dray and Klay was in Space Jam 2. They can get LeBron by trading Wiggins, Salary, and FRP.

Also, in 2017-18 the rockets were clearly the 2nd best team in the league. It was an intense series, and one they almost lost due to KD isoing too much and almost lost them the series. Curry had to take over and won the series for them against the 2nd best team.

KD got the better stats in the 2018 finals, but was Curry more important to help win? If Cavs decided instead to focus on KD and double him, obviously Steph would have put up much better stats.",1,32,5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

**Trade 1:** Spurs trade Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, receive DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, and 2019 TOR 1st (became the 29th pick, used to select Keldon Johnson)

**Trade 2:** Spurs sign and trade away DeMar DeRozan, receive Thaddeus Young, Al-Farouq Aminu (waived), 2025 CHI 1st, 2022 LAL 2nd, 2025 CHI 2nd

**Trade 3:** Spurs trade Thaddeus Young, Drew Eubanks, and 2022 DET 2nd, receive Goran Dragic (bought out) and 2022 TOR 1st (lottery protected)


**Overall results:**

**Traded away:** Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Drew Eubanks, 2022 DET 2nd

3360,63,The Owners Should Prioritize Increasing Age for the Draft,"Since 2005, the NBA disallowed players being drafted directly from high school. While there were mega-successes like KG, Kobe, and LeBron, there were also a significant number of flops and teams hated the difficulty in scouting and uncertainty of drafting players who hadn't yet performed against better competition.

The one-and-done rule is fraught with it's own issues, but at least provides NBA teams with the ability to see players in one season of competition at the college level, or in some cases, overseas/in the G-league.

There are whispers of being mutual agreement between the NBPA and owners to go back to allowing players to enter the NBA draft, but I think the owners particularly should pivot in the other direction.

The owners should prioritize instituting a two-years-removed from high school policy. My primary argument for this is that small market owners need to gain any potential edge to compete with the player-empowerment era and concentration of talent amongst the most desirable teams/locations. The current draft rules, and even worse if kids can be taken from HS again, is most disadvantageous to small market teams.

 The reason for this is teams only have control for the rookie contract (4 years) plus restricted free agency. Players can sign a 5-year max with incumbent teams and get a player option after 4, or if they prioritize flexibility, take the 4-year max and get a PO after 3. So, essentially, teams really have to start worrying about trading young stars as early as five years into their career if they're unhappy and/or there are whispers of them leaving, because otherwise, they risk losing the player for nothing in free agency or a lesser return if there's only one year left on the deal.

No ALL-NBA level talent has yet taken the qualifying offer (making a player an unrestricted free agent after fifth year), but it's going to happen, potentially with Zion.

Based on the above, small market teams need drafted players to be as ready to contribute at a high level as possible coming into the league. Overwhelmingly, guys who play multiple years of college, come in better prepared to do so (Steph, Dame, Duncan, D-Wade). Requiring two years before the NBA draft will mean a player will be more physically and emotionally mature and will have had more experience playing a lot of minutes against solid competition, whether college, international, or G-league.

As an example for this need, look at Anfernee Simons. Simons came in the league one year removed from high school, where he played a post-grad year at IMG academy. He was incredibly raw and struggled to find minutes on a solid playoff team loaded at the guard position. Now he's just starting to find his groove as a contributing player four years into his career, and the Blazers are already having to determine if they need to give him a huge contract. They got essentially zero value for this pick during the entire life of his rookie deal, during a time when they could have used another good rotation player to complement Dame/CJ.

As a team example, look at the Magic or the Kings, who are consistently in the lottery and having to develop very young players. Having to consistently integrate 19-20 year old players in a rotation is setting a team up to have a very long curve of competing, and they often have to trade or let those players go before they fully realize their potential to make room for developing their new crop of lottery picks. Increasing the draft age will bring in more NBA-ready players, while also decreasing tanking, because it will be more difficult to tank with more NBA-ready players.

The most common argument against increasing the draft age is generally that it's unfairly punitive to young guys from impoverished backgrounds being able to make money when the market is ready to accept them. Well, first, if I'm an NBA owner that's not my problem. I want to better my product, and specifically if I am one of the 25 or so non-glamour franchises, I want to level the playing field and increase the value of my franchise. There's no compelling reason why allowing one-and-done or straight from high school is at all beneficial to the NBA.

Also, barring injury, the data does not necessarily support that a star player is sacrificing money by playing multiple years of post-high school/pre-NBA ball. Look at the longevity of Duncan's career or Chris Paul's or Kyle Lowry's or the plethora of other examples of 2+ year college players having success 15 seasons into their careers. 

Regarding injuries, it's unfortunate if a promising player is derailed by an injury in college/overseas before being drafted, but ultimately, that's an inherent risk of the sport. One can take out an insurance policy before playing an NBA minute, and even with injuries, most injuries will not preclude 100% (or close to it) recovery. But again, the NBA should not be in the business of making decisions based on what's most beneficial to 18-year-olds. They have to consider the league's best interest.

Also, the NBAPA will likely cave on this because NBA players care more about what impacts them than what is going to impact players not even yet in the league!

In summation, given the landscape of the modern NBA and rookie/second contracts, most teams are negatively impacted by having to draft high lottery picks who are not NBA ready and are going to take longer to develop into stars. That is easily mitigated by ensuring drafted players are more physically and emotionally prepared to play immediately.",1,57,9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

3376,79,Why was Kris Middleton an All Star this season?,"This isn't a hate post since I do like Middleton a bit but his all star selection this season imo is undeserving. While in the past I (and many people) thought that Middleton was underrated and was never given the credit he deserved but for the all star selection this season I think it is the opposite. Some counting stat comparisons : 


* Kris Middleton : 19.4 PPG, 43.8 FG%, 35.6 3PT%, 5.5 RB, 5.3 AST

* Jrue Holiday : 18.1 PPG, 50 FG%, 40 3PT%, 4.6 RB, 6.6 AST

* Pascal Siakam : 22 PPG, 49.5 FG%, 34.8 3PT%, 8.7 RB, 5.2 AST

* Jaylen Brown : 23.7 PPG, 46 FG%, 35.3 3PT%, 6.5 RB, 3.3 AST


Counting stats is not the best metric when comparing a players impact for their team but I truly believe players should have been considered over Middleton. There is always an argument to be made about a teams seeding can affect their player's chances of getting selected as an all star but Jrue Holiday has been more efficient on offense with better defense than Middleton has been for the Bucks this season. Thoughts?

In light of recent [news](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10027517-nba-wont-add-in-season-tournament-next-season-commissioner-adam-silver-says) from Commissioner Adam Silver about introducing the idea of the In-Season Tournament, I decided to take it upon myself to come up with my own idea on how to implement it as well as finding ways to make it work within the schedule. Please keep in mind that this is mostly a mock-up and just an idea, so any discussions on what was good and/or bad is greatly appreciated and please leave feedback in the comments below.

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction:

My idea of the in-season tournament, which I unofficially named ""The Lottery Gauntlet"" is a playoff-style format tournament for the bottom 7 teams of each conference to compete in, in order to get the best lottery odds for the upcoming NBA draft. Before you scroll down to the comments and go off about how stupid of an idea this is, hear me out. I will do my best to explain and demonstrate how this would work, so please bear with me. And if there was anything that wasn't clear, please let me know and I will do my best to clarify.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thing to address is shortening the 82-game season. Many might call this blasphemous as 82 games has been the ""standard"" for some time in the NBA but like all things in life, change is inevitable.  I propose shrinking it down to a 70-game season with clearly defined halves of the season:

* The first 35 games
* The Lottery Gauntlet
* All-Star Break
* The last 35 games

The Lottery Gauntlet would take place in the time frame of the extra 12 games removed from the 82-game schedule. The All-Star break can take place right after the Lottery Gauntlet in its usually spot. The reasoning behind all this is two-fold. Firstly, it can serve as an extended resting period for the top 8-seeded teams in each conference, especially those who are proponents of ""load management"". Secondly, it gives an opportunity for the bottom 7-seeded teams to be highlighted and gives them something to compete and fight for and giving both the players and the teams a taste of what the competition is like in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

The Lottery Gauntlet could also serve to replace some, if not all, of the events that take place during All-Star Weekend (ie. Celebrity All-Star game, the Skills Challenge, the Dunk Contest, etc). This way, there is some actual level of competition and gives an opportunity for bad teams to fight for something good rather than half-hearted participation in events that people don't have much interest in. (Also, gambling on the Gauntlet to see who wins rather than who will win the Skills Challenge would probably be more exciting.)

&amp;#x200B;

With all that being said, let's move on to how this would actually work.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Lottery Gauntlet:

The way this would work is like this: the teams in the bottom 7 standings from both conferences, in theory, should mostly be franchises in their various stages of ""rebuilding"", ranging from the perpetually disappointing Kings to the surprisingly mediocre Pacers. Majority of these teams should have young players that are developing or being developed and, as a result, will most likely not be making the playoffs. BY introducing the Lottery Gauntlet, it gives the bottom 7 teams of each conference an opportunity to ""test their metal"" in a tournament that is similar to the playoffs format and give them a taste of what real competition is like when competing for the NBA Championship. It would also double as a way to showcase young talent and rising stars in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

As of today's date, 02/22/2022 (or 2022/02/22 for the non-American audience), these are the standings for the [Eastern Conference](https://imgur.com/Qyw9H78) and the [Western Conference](https://imgur.com/spNWSad). Taking the bottom 7 teams from each conference, this is how I am formatting the Lottery Gauntlet to play out in terms of seeding:

* [West](https://imgur.com/sHvjCND)
* [East](https://imgur.com/kOazuUm)

The 9^(th)\-seed teams, in this example being the Charlotte Hornets and the Los Angeles Lakers, would become the pseudo 1^(st)\-seed in the Gauntlet and would get a bye for the first round of the tournament. The rest of the teams in each conference, 10th to 15th, are then placed in that order and they will each play a best-of-3 (BO3) to determine who moves on to the next round. And again, in that next round, another BO3 is played to determine who moves on, up until the actual [Gauntlet Finals](https://imgur.com/mmxWjyJ), with one team from each conference facing each other in either a final BO3 or BO5 to determine which franchise gets the highest lottery odds for the draft. The loser of that Gauntlet Finals then get the second highest lottery odds for the draft, and so forth for the rest of the teams that participated in the Gauntlet.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's play through an imaginary and hypothetical scenario, using the current standings and the images of the seedings I have provided. Let's say, for the sake of argument in this hypothetical tournament, that the Portland Trailblazers came out of the Western Conference and the New York Knicks came out of the Eastern Conference. They both duke it out and, lo and behold, the New York Knicks/Portland Trailblazers came out on top (I will go through both team scenarios).

&amp;#x200B;

For the New York Knicks, it gives them an opportunity to reinvigorate their franchise for some  desperately needed good news as well as winning the best lottery odds for the team in drafting a star young player. It could also serve as a good trade bait to swing in front of another team in order to trade for that “franchise guy” the Knicks have desperately tried to get for a long time but to no success. 

Some of you then might complain that this would only help the big market teams, so in order to address this, let’s jump to the other scenario. 

For the Portland Trailblazers, it would function similarly to the Knicks but with one big difference on their roster - Damian Lillard (the emergence of Anfernee Simons this season has been amazing and I will address it). Assuming that Lillard is 1000% confirmed to commit to the team as a lifer until the day he retires, the Trailblazers can use the assumed first pick (via the high lottery odds) as a trade bait to get that second superstar that Dame needs to bring a ring back to Portland. However, in the case that Dame's future with the franchise is uncertain, the Trailblazers can get an early head start on their ""rebuild"" by using the assumed first pick to draft a young star player to develop along side Anfernee Simons and move forward from there. 

This would ultimately incentivize teams around the league to actually keep and develop their young talent and build around a core of young players that get organically built up, rather than grabbing for straws and trading for disgruntled vets at a feeble attempt to make a run in the play-in tournament, much less the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that the scenario I just went through was purely hypothetical and will realistically not happen since the decisions that the front offices of each team can and will wildly differ from the opinions of those who browse this subreddit. I just wanted to at least try and paint a picture of how I hope and imagine things play out but that decision is ultimately up to Commissioner Adam Silver and the board of governors/owners that run the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

As I mentioned earlier, the biggest thing to address is shortening the 82-game season before tackling anything else. I propose dropping it to a 70-game season, where it would serve a dual function of giving the top 8-seeded teams a rest after the first 35 games and giving the bottom 7-seeded teams something to fight for in a playoff-style tournament via the Lottery Gauntlet. By making the season 70 games, there is a cleaner way of measuring out the first half of the season and the second half of the season for each team. As a fan of the game, it would definitely generate interest as it is an opportunity to see upcoming young talent on ""bad"" teams as well as building up hype for any incoming rookies, whether they come from college, the G-League, or even overseas. This would also, by proxy, inherently make teams be better in scouting and developing their young talent, rather than taking gambles and trading away future assets for a ""quick-fix"" solution that may not even work.

&amp;#x200B;

  

# Some drawbacks/scenarios to consider: 

* Some of the players (mostly vets) may think that there’s no incentive in participating in such a tournament when you can have an extended break.
   * Outside of monetary compensation, there isn’t much else to convince the older players and vets to participate in the tournament and they would probably prefer to take time off, which they are free to do. In place, I think the Lottery Gauntlet could replace the “Rising Stars” challenge/game as it can put the young players and talents through a competitive format similar to the playoffs and give them something to compete for.
* What would be actual incentives for players and teams, other than the high draft pick odds?
   *  Again, outside of monetary compensation, a few ideas I thought of includes a Gauntlet Championship Title (complete with a trophy) as well as a Gauntlet Finals MVP (trophy included). Another idea I had was that there also be a separate Gauntlet MVP to highlight the best young player out of all the bottom 7 teams in both conferences (given out before the Gauntlet Finals) and if the young player is able to secure the Gauntlet championship, Finals MVP, and MVP, all the more reason to continue building around the young player.
* What if a franchise that wins the Lottery Gauntlet also wins the NBA championship?
   * Then it’s a win-win for everybody, isn’t it? Whatever team that somehow ends up winning both the Lottery Gauntlet and the NBA championship get the rare opportunity, and deservedly so, to continue competing for championships while also achieving a high draft pick for being able to get through the Gauntlet, the play-in tournament, and then the entire playoffs. What the team does with the high draft pick (whether they decide to make and keep their pick or trade it for other pieces) is up to the team but it’s something for teams to achieve, as a sort of “hat trick” to compete and win through all three: the Gauntlet, play-in tournament, and the playoffs.
* What about teams that would sign free agents and minimum veterans just to gut it out in the Lottery Gauntlet at a feeble attempt at trying to get the high draft pick?
   * I would be lying if I said that there is an easy solution to this but there isn’t. There’s nothing, outside of massive rule changes or Commissioner Adam Silver pulling a David Stern and coming in off the top rope, that can prevent a team from pulling this off. And I don’t think Commissioner Silver is going to interfere unless a team does something so egregious in their attempts of pulling this scenario off. And as I mentioned earlier, the veterans can opt out of competing in the Gauntlet for the extended break rather than putting themselves at risk for injury. The flip side would be if a veteran does decide to participate in the Lottery Gauntlet, it gives contending teams the ability to scout and look for players to sign in order to compete for a championship.
* What about the trade deadline and the buyout market deadline?
   * Keep them both the same for the most part, with only changing the timings of the trade deadline to be after the Lottery Gauntlet but before All-Star break. The reasoning behind this for me is that for vets who might be on one of these bottom 7-seeded teams from both conferences could use the Gauntlet as an opportunity to get traded to a championship contending team by showcasing their abilities to contribute to a winning situation. But once the Gauntlet and All-Star break is over, whatever players that are on the roster for championship contenders are stuck with what they have, outside of making moves during the buyout market.

**TL;DR - Shorten season from 82 games to 70 games. Turn the time spent from the missing 12 games to turn it into an in-season tournament for the bottom 7-seeded teams from each conference while giving a reprieve for the top 8-seeded teams from each conference. The in-season tournament becomes a fight for the highest draft lottery odds, with the winning team getting the highest odds and the following subsequent teams getting slightly lesser odds.**",1,57,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

--

**BEST LIVE ACTION SHORT**

Considered a minor award at the Oscars, our NBA equivalent will honor the best undersized player in the NBA. Who's giving us the most pound for pound and inch for inch? The 160-pound Trae Young is a perpetual contender, but it feels odd to give him a trophy in a year when Atlanta is on the outside of the playoff picture. Instead, let's go with **Fred VanVleet.** Undrafted out of Wichita State, VanVleet was always flagged for his limited athleticism and his limited size (6'0"" with a 6'1"" wingspan). Despite his lack of an ideal frame, VanVleet's excelled thanks to his shooting ability (up to 40% on 10 threes a game) but also his activity and energy across the board. More than a one-dimensional scorer, the shorty has averaged 4.6 rebounds, 1.7 steals, and even 0.5 blocks per game.

---

**BEST ORIGINAL SCORE**

We're used to high scoring games these days, but **Memphis** raised our eyebrows with their 152-79 rout of the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 2nd. It was the largest margin of victory in NBA history. More impressive still, the Grizzlies did it without Ja Morant.

---

**BEST COSTUME DESIGN**

The NBA is always trotting out new uniform designs in order to squeeze every last cent for their poor fans and sometimes that results in some clunkers. However, I happen to like **Charlotte's ""city""** jerseys, with the ombre color and the honeycomb pattern at top. There's a certain galactic superhero look to it that fits especially well with a young and exciting core like the Hornets have.

---

**BEST MAKEUP and HAIRSTYLING**

We have some great/goofy hair across the league, from Jarrett Allen's afro to Kelly Oubre's blond poof. But since this Oscar category now includes makeup, let's hear it for **LeBron James** and his hairline. It's not easy to excel at age 37, fighting your competition and male pattern baldness along the way. More savvy still, James' expanding beard helps hide his suspiciously expanding jawline.

---

**BEST DOC-UMENTARY**

We all love the true life, behind-the-scenes soap opera of the NBA, and this season has provided plenty of it. There's some eerie silence with Zion Williamson in New Orleans and too much noise about Kyrie Irving's philosophy in Brooklyn, but the main storyline that's dominated the headlines and morning shows has been the **Ben Simmons saga in Philadelphia.** We've rarely seen a superstar miss extended time with [DNP - Hurt Feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuJzSTNDUGI) before. Add in a fiery resolution that may affect the title picture, and you have an Oscar worthy documentary here.

---

**BEST ANIMATED FEATURE**

We're using this award to honor the best personality in the NBA this year. And to that end, Minnesota wing **Anthony Edwards** has captured our hearts like *Encanto*. You can't stop singing We Don't Talk About Bruno, and you can't stop forwarding your friends Edwards' latest press conference quotes either.

---

**BEST SOUND**

We could use this category to pick the best soundbite from Anthony Edwards or Charles Barkley, but how about some love for the best NBA podcast? After all, there are about 100,000 to choose from. The trouble is: most basketball podcasts get a little stale -- either the analyst gets too arrogant and set in their opinions, or they slowly become disinterested in the sport and stop watching games. That problem doesn't apply to the [**No Dunks**](https://theathletic.com/podcast/119-no-dunks/) podcast. The gang has survived several different iterierations (Basketball Jones, The Starters, etc) and always maintained their enthusiasm and chemistry.

---

**BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN**

One of the most fun aspects of watching basketball and being an armchair GM is that a basketball roster is more of a delicate potion than other sports. In baseball, you can just add good hitter after good hitter and expect a certain result; in basketball, different stars and role players align better than others and affect each other in more direct ways.

If chemistry is a scientific art, then Chicago exec **Arturas Karnisovas** got branded as a mad scientist for ""overpaying"" for DeMar DeRozan this summer. After all, DeRozan was an empty calorie scorer! The Bulls (31-41 last season) weren't anywhere close to contention anyway! What a disaster!

As it turns out, DeRozan has helped spark a major turnaround for the Bulls, who are closing in on their preseason over/under (of 42.5) already. DeRozan is scoring 28 points per game on 60% true shooting. It would be a shocker, if DeRozan hadn't registered 60% and 59% TS the last two years in San Antonio. Karnisovas and company realized the value to that and found a great way to add production to the team, whose offense has jumped from 19th to 3rd.

---

**BEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE**

Previously known as ""best foreign film,"" we have plenty of candidates here to award the best international player in the NBA. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, etc. Among them, we're giving this to **Nikola Jokic.** On top of his absurd and MVP-worthy stats (26-14-8 on excellent efficiency), Jokic is arguably the most ""foreign"" among them in terms of his exotic and hard-to-translate game. After all, it's still hard for many to mentally process how a goofy doughboy has the skill to dominate the competition.

---

**BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY**

A cinematographer (also known as a ""DP"" for director of photography) is an undervalued player on a set, setting up and filming shots in a way that most attribute to a director's role. And if we're talking about setting up and framing shots in a certain way, then **Daryl Morey** takes this award for his role in the aforementioned Ben Simmons drama. All season long, he set the table and sold the narrative that the Sixers didn't need to force or rush a Simmons trade this season despite the fact that their centerpiece Joel Embiid is right in the middle of his prime (at age 27) and has a precarious injury history. People wanted to rush Morey, but he had the artistic vision to wait. And wait. And wait. And then he *clicked* his shot at the perfect time, right in the magic hour of the deadline. Say whatever you want about James Harden, but he's certainly better than a $30M hole in your cap sheet.

**BEST EDITING**

The editor is the last line of defense in the movie making process -- and at times, they have to figure out how to polish a turd as best as possible. To that end, the Clippers' **Lawrence Frank** and Ty Lue have done that. Almost everything went wrong this season -- highlighted by injuries to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. To make matters even worse, the Clippers couldn't ""tank"" and punt the season away because they don't own their own R1 pick (which goes to OKC.) Somehow, someway, the team needed to polish this turd of a circumstance and make due. And they've done exactly that, staying afloat in a tough Western Conference. Better still, Frank managed to trade for Norman Powell, a solid wing who will serve two purposes: he'll help them stay near .500 this year, but he'll also fit on next year's title-contending team. The fact that *this* team is ahead of their cross-town rival Lakers shows a lot about the quality of their staff and organization.

---

**BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**

The NBA is a copycat league, and that's only increased since analytics took over. Everyone wants to push the pace and jack up threes. Everyone wants wings -- the more wings the better!

Given that, Cleveland GM **Koby Altman** earned some criticism for his roster construction these last few years. One year after drafting scoring guard Collin Sexton, he drafted *another* small guard in Darius Garland. Less than one year after trading for (and extending) true center in Jarrett Allen, he drafted *another* 7 footer in Evan Mobley. And acquired *another* in Lauri Markkanen. Apparently he didn't get the memo about wings because the Cavs seemed to be going for a roster with anything BUT.

As it happens, that turned out well. Mobley and Allen have formed a wall on defense that ranks 4th in the league, and Garland's skill and star power has outweighed any concerns about his size. Sure, the idea of going for a ""best player available"" approach isn't wholly original, but original is a low bar in Hollywood.

---

**BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY**

NBA teams go through life cycles. You rebuild, improve, and hopefully contend. It's like a child learning to walk and then run. And when your window looks closed, you're supposed to accept your fate and die gracefully in the beautiful flames of a ""blow it up"" firesale. It's the Viking funeral of sports teams.

The Golden State Warriors were the latest team to shrug off their death and stave off a rebuild despite a brutal string of injury luck. They effectively gave up on the 2019-20 season and loaded up on draft picks in the meantime, a la Steve Kerr's old team the San Antonio Spurs with Tim Duncan. James Wiseman hasn't been Tim Duncan -- or Dwight Howard -- or even Dwight Powell -- but Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody look promising and Wiseman still has time to do the same. More than anything, the Warriors showed that it's OK to take a year off. It's not a rebuild or a white flag -- it's a soft tank for a year. A ""punt.""

**Masai Ujiri** and the Toronto Raptors followed in those footsteps. Last season was a nightmare all the way around, leading to a disappointing 27-45 season. However, they took advantage of that one-year punt, grabbed promising rookie Scottie Barnes, and jumped right back up to the playoff picture this season. We may see more and more punts in the future, particularly if it works for Portland and Damian Lillard this year.

---

**BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR**

It's sometimes difficult for the Academy Awards to differentiate between a ""lead"" and ""supporting"" role. They nominated Lakeith Stanfield for ""Best Supporting Actor"" in *Judas and the Black Messiah* despite his character being the lead. Meanwhile, Anthony Hopkins won ""Best Actor"" in *Silence of the Lambs* despite appearing for only 16 minutes on screen.

We can quibble with the same distinction here in our NBA Oscars. Are we saying it's the greatest ""second best player"" on a team? If so, you can argue for the lesser of the power duos between Devin Booker or Chris Paul in Phoenix, or Donovan Mitchell / Rudy Gobert in Utah, or DeMar DeRozan / Zach LaVine in Chicago. 

However, the way that we're taking this award is to mean the best player who has more of a *supporting role*, as in a great overqualified role player. By that standard, you'd look more to players like Steven Adams. He's quietly been crashing the glass and crunching on screens for Memphis. Still, the player who jumps out as the prototypical role player or 3+D template right now is probably **Mikal Bridges.** He's one of the glue guys for the top seed despite averaging less than 14 PPG. His contract (set to balloon to $20M) shows he's more than a role player, but Steven Adams is also on a big deal himself at $17M.

---

**BEST ACTOR**

We can make a joke about flopping here, but let's try and use this major award as analogous to ""Best Player.""

Oddly, the field mirrors the field for ""Best International Feature"" -- with Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Giannis Antetokounmpo jockeying for positioning. Jokic took the prior award, but we're handing this one out to **Giannis Antetokounmpo** instead. Even after a title, it feels like fans have taken Antetokounmpo's dominance for granted. He's back up to 29-11-6 again on incredible efficiency, and he has the edge on Jokic and most others when it comes to his defense.

More than that, Antetokounmpo represents what we want a superstar and ""Best Actor"" to be. That is: he plays hard every night on both ends. He plays with a love of the game. He acts with an appreciation for his fans and an off-the-court humility that must be hard to maintain when you're arguably the best player on the planet. He's the type of player we want all our superstars to act like.

---

**BEST DIRECTOR**

We'll equate a director with a coach more so than a GM, and that effectively makes this the ""Coach of the Year"" award. In real life, that tends to go to the coach who had the biggest turnaround or the biggest overachievement, but you'd be hard pressed to find a director on top of his game like **Monty Williams** has been for the Phoenix Suns. The Suns were a laughingstock before he arrived, but he's sifted through that garbage dump and built a well-oiled machine. 

In NBA awards (Coach of the Year or otherwise), we tend to neglect the person who's already arrived and get distracted by the shiny new storyline instead. But if we're talking about coaching, isn't it just as hard to get a team that reached the Finals locked in during the regular season? Not only did the Suns improve and take control of the # 1 seed, they're beating the next best team by 5+ games. It's not easy to instill that type of self-motivation.

---

**BEST PICTURE**

Best Picture is the ""big award"" of the night and given to the best overall film, so we're going to use this to award the best overall team. 

In many Oscar years, we see a sweep through all major categories. Can the Phoenix Suns be the *Ben Hur* of this season? They've already won Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director, and now Best Picture as well? 

In fact, if we use on-court production alone, the Phoenix Suns may win this award running away. They have the best record, the best SRS (schedule adjusted power rank), the best net rating. Their offense and defense are both in the top 5 (at # 4 and # 3 respectively.) Their depth is strong -- their chemistry is strong -- their coaching staff is strong. Anyone who thought last year's title run was a fluke has some egg on their face right now, because the Suns have been the best team this season.

But wait... there's a delay at the podium... Warren Beatty is looking around, confused... 

Apparently Chris Paul's injury has led to a last minute recount. And if CP3's durability leaves a cloud hanging over the rest of the season, who should take this award from the Suns? 

Well, how about the team that beat them *last* year? Sure, the **Milwaukee Bucks** have been coasting through the regular season with a 36-23 record and a rank of # 9 in SRS. And sure, their depth is somewhat shaky given some injuries (notably Brook Lopez.) Vegas doesn't respect them much either, ranking them 4th in title odds. Still, they just won the title and are bringing back 95% of the same team again. Why should this year be that much different?

At the end of the day, the Bucks still have one trump card: Giannis fuckin' A. He averaged 35-13 last year against Phoenix, and I'm still not sure if they have the right pieces to stop him. He's a kaiju tearing his way through the States. In turn, Jrue Holiday is one of the most ideal defenders to stop a good backcourt like Phoenix. The East is no cakewalk, but the Bucks have proven that they can shrug off their playoff demons and get the job done. So to me, they have the least amount of questions in the field, and the best chance to win the title (again.)

I think the why’s and how’s of Melo leaving Denver are hard for some fans to get over. While I was upset when he was traded/left, I do think many fans here treat him unfairly. He basically single-handedly helped turn the Nuggets franchise around and we became instant and annual playoff contenders.

Ultimately, I hope both Melo, Nuggs fans and the franchise can mend any wounds as he does deserve to be honored here in Denver at some point in the future as he was a very important piece of our success and history.

For me the 2 cities that I would give NBA teams to would be:

Las Vegas and Seattle 

Why? Las Vegas already have an NHL team the Golden Knights and they have the Raiders for NFL. So I am sure they could support a team for the NBA as well. Vegas is an entertainment capital of the world but also it would be a free agency destination most definitely amongst players especially if Vegas ended up with a team. They definitely have the money and the revenue to support it. Plus they are on the West coast also. Plus they had an All Star weekend in Vegas 15 years ago in 2007. So not that much of a stretch to have an expansion team there in the future if it presents itself.


Seattle...why? Because of the rich history Seattle has with the NBA. SuperSonics or the Sonics whatever you wanna call them were a staple, an institution in the NBA in the 70s, 80s and 90s and in the early 00s before they moved them away from Seattle and to OKC. They deserve a 2nd chance at having a team again. Plus they have a new arena in Seattle. Not to mention Seattle have the Kraken now in the NHL.

3446,49,What team will Lebron play for next year?,I think it’s a given that Lebron is leaving the Lakers. I know personally when Lebron starts talking like this he’s done.

I know OKC have all these draft picks and they could easily draft his son but I’m not completely sure if Lebron is saying he wants to play with his son to get him drafted or truly means it. Could be a little bit of both. I think when it comes down to it I see him going back to Cleveland and them doing their best to trade for his son. It’s the only organization that will cave in to whatever demands he wants. That being said while it’s not explicitly said by lebron it will inevitably happen and I don’t know how that isn’t tampering.

Embiid has played exactly 306 regular-season games in his career; if he played every game he was eligible for, that'd be 82 games each year from 2014-15 to 2018-19, plus 73 games in 2019-20 (the stoppage and late schedule change in the bubble meant some teams ended the season at 72 games and others, including the Sixers, played 73), 72 games in 2020-21, and 58 games so far this year, for a total of 613 games.

Despite missing the first two seasons of his career entirely, and missing significant portions of every season he's actually played in, Embiid is now at a point where he needs to play exactly one more game to break even. 

(Incidentally, Embiid has missed 12 games out of 58 this year. If he keeps up that pace, he'll end the year having played exactly 65 games, which is just one more than his career high in a season.

&gt;  
&gt;And then there's Jokic. And so, at this point, heading into this playoffs coming up, my expectation, the thing I'm asking myself, as I watch Jokic, as I try to compare him to other players, as I try to evaluate his impact in this season, in his time. Is this the greatest offensive player of all-time?

I know the Last Dance documented about how the Pistons famously walked off the court and also the Dream Team snub of Isiah that happened in 1992. But it seems to me that Mj and Isiah still had a good relationship during the 90s despite all of this. I watched a NBA 50th anniversary video on yt that happened in 97', and it seemed that Mj and Isiah were very cordial. I'm confused as to why if these events that supposedly caused their feud happened before this 50th anniversary, why does the walk off and dream team snub bother both of them now if they were cool with it back then.",1,50,9,-0.3947,0.25,0.75,0.0

Kawhi even dominated against peak KD's Warriors in Game 1 and it could've been a competitive if it wasn't for Zaza. Whereas DeMar DeRozan was generally shite in playoffs.

3572,75,Whats the reason why Michael Jordan has failed to win as an NBA owner and would Lebron do any better ?,"As a lifelong NBA fan who grew up at the end of the Jordan years with the Bulls this is a very interesting topic for me. The man had an insane drive to win. It seems odd to me that he has not won more as an owner. The only 3 reasons I can think of is....  


Possibility A: Charlotte in not a destination for NBA superstars. When stars have formed super teams its usually in cities like Houston, Miami or Brooklyn (close to New York). All those cities have vibrant club scenes and are large media markets.   


Possibility B: Players afraid to be in Jordan's shadow. I feel players say they want to be the next Jordan but maybe they would rather be the first them.   


Possibility C: He doesn't know how to assemble a team. This seems like the least possible to me. How does a guy who played on 6 NBA championship teams as well as going up against some of the greatest teams ever like Bird's Celtics and the Showtime Lakers not know what it takes to build a winner?  


Possibility D: He didn't buy the Bobcats (now Hornets) to win championships. It was more a business decision. I don't buy this either. Because of his competitive nature. He is a winner and I would imagine it would really frustrate him to see once obscure teams like the Warriors go on and win multiple championships. Imagine how it would enhance his legacy in basketball to win a championship as an owner? 

  
Also about Lebron who has stated after retirement he wants to own a team. I honestly feel like he could be a better owner than Jordan. But I do feel he would need to buy a team in a bigger market. As he found out its hard to recruit guys to Cleveland. I feel like if he could buy the Heat or the Lakers someday he could kill it. And I think it would be something he'd want to do because it would be an arena where he could get the best of Jordan in.

Play in round 2:

Brooklyn Nets (8) vs. Atlanta Hawks (10)

I can see it now. The Hawks conjure their 2021 magic, Trae goes for 51, K’von hits back-to-back heat check 3s, Collins has BDE after dunking over KD to tie it late. BKN loses the play-in tournament because Kyrie sucks as a human being.

Round 1

Miami Heat (1) vs. Atlanta Hawks (8) 

Trae Young is still the best player in this series, so you can’t count them out.

Chicago Bulls (2) vs. Toronto Raptors (7)

While not rivals, I think this would be an interesting matchup.

It is inherently not true with the Heat and Cavs as the Heat made the playoffs 2 years after Lebron left and were only a few years in rebuilding before signing Jimmy Butler then landing another finals appearance and is now currently the first seed in the East. For the Cavs, yes they sucked for a few years after Bron left the 2nd time but now that they have a competent front office, they are now in playoff contention for the first time without Lebron in like 3 decades. I also find it funny that there seems to be a pattern that during the 4th year Lebron is with a team, the team goes to shit but with the Heat and the Cavs, it wasn't even his fault at all and both teams were able to reach the finals. For the Heat in 2014, they ran into an All-Time Spurs team and at that time, Wade's knees were falling apart. For the Cavs in 2018, Kyrie requested a trade and the return for  him didn't work out which led to the team getting gutted at the all-star break.

Now many experts are projecting Bronny as a second round pick. 

But allegedly, drafting Bronny is like drafting Bron for one year. I believe OKC is perfect for the James’ based on this and one other reason-

James Harden, KD, and Russ all played on the same team at OKC. If Bron can win a title in OKC at age 39, he would certify himself as the greatest NBA player to ever play, on a similar level of Tom Brady winning in Tampa. (I already think he’s the goat)",1,43,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Leaves in 2018 after Kyrie gets traded, Love on a big decline. Leaving the Cavs initially in a bad salary and rebuilding situation.

\- Joins the Lakers and has them trade their entire farm (including picks) for Anthony Davis. While the move proved to be a success, he then forces the Lakers hand by having them trade all of their assets for a declining and very questionable fit in Russell Westbrook. Now they are left with vet min level players as their 3rd and 4th best players while Westbrook predictable didn’t fit, AD’s injuries nagging the Lakers head, and now LeBron is looking to bounce yet again once his contract is up. Perhaps this time, letting himself get traded for the first time in his career.

As great of a player he is, he seems to have a pattern of leaving a team in ruins whenever a situation doesn’t go his way for the time being. Giannis never left the Bucks despite how small of a market they were and how they never won anything before deciding he would extend his contract and stay. He’s now being rewarded for it with a title, and now on his way to repeat. 

You see a player like that, vs LeBron bouncing when an opportunity arises, that’s gotta be a red flag to his legacy, no?",1,47,8,-0.5267,0.327,0.673,0.0

If Steph goes off like that again after the All-Star break this season and leads the Warriors to the #1 seed (which should be much easier than before due to CP3's injury), he can easily win MVP, as now he has the narrative again due to his otherworldly performance in the All-Star game.",1,55,13,0.5859,0.0,0.759,0.241

3660,63,[Discussion] Elam ending vs traditional game clock,"The All Star game ended by playing to 163 (vs until the clock expires). I've really enjoyed this format every time I've seen it done. And, it feels natural because this is how most pickup basketball works. It makes the game feel qualitatively different - maybe it's because there's a clearer ending that's focused on an outcome vs the clock is up whoever is up wins.

One thing the NBA should do is use any non regular season/playoff game as a way to experiment with these ideas. Why not do this in the pre-season, G league, use it for the proposed in-season tournament, etc?

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	--	|	48-10	|	So yeah, Chris Paul is likely out 6 weeks with a shooting hand thumb sprain which is most if not all of the regular season... Which is a bummer but he should be back for the playoffs fresh and ready to go. On the bright side, the Suns have a 6.5 game lead for the 1st seed and Payne and Shamet are expected to return from their injuries this week. To set the franchise record for best record they just need to finish out the season 15-9, which still feels attainable. Also, Cam Johnson was SNUBBED from 3-Point Contest. 	|
2	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	--	|	42-17	|	Curry lit the all-star game up with 16 3s. This is a good sign for post All-Star Steph. Some of Kerr's decisions these past few close game losses has the fan's head scratching and it is clear that the Warriors need Draymond to be considered in the contender tier. Kuminga has been huge in the month of February averaging 15/4/2 on an absurd 67.2 TS%.	|
3	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	--	|	41-19	|	Coming off his 1st all-star appearance, Ja is positioned to lead this team to a deep playoff run. Combined with the fact that we have one of the easiest remaining schedules, and that we'll be getting our best defender (2nd best?) back in Dillon Brooks, the team will finally get some extended minutes to see their best line up of Ja, Bane, Brooks, JJJ, Adams. The ceiling on this team is as high as the Finals, however they seem to lack a consistent 5th gear that will be required to knock off the top teams in the league. 	|
4	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	--	|	38-21	|	Well, we traded KZ Okpala like it was speculated prior to deadline but that turned out the only move we would make on the deadline. We used the available space to sign Caleb Martin to a contract for the rest of the season. The roster doesn't feel like it has a lot of depth, but Spo's staff continues to churn out depth and role players. Although looking now at the contract information it was unlikely there would be anything else possible. 	|
5	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	+3	|	38-21	|		|
6	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	--	|	35-23	|	""James Harden is a Sixer."" The singular phrase has captured the attention of every single Philadelphia fan and honestly most basketball fans. In theory, the fit should be brilliant. Harden has a way of making big men look better, and Embiid can finally have the perimeter creator that he always wished Ben Simmons would evolve into. Did the Sixers give up a lot? Maybe. Seth Curry provided valuable spacing and Andre Drummond was the best backup big that Philly has had in the Embiid era, but they also came with their own flaws. You can guarantee every eye is looking towards that Friday debut. Player to watch: James Harden. I don't think this needs to be specified. 	|
7	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	-2	|	36-24	|	The Bucks limped into the ASB on a 2-3 run since our last rankings. Pat Connaughton breaking a finger on his shooting hand the game after Donte got traded, and an injury to George Hill's neck have destroyed the team's guard depth for the time being. Hopefully the buyout market can fix that problem with the addition of Bembry (and Dragić???). In other news, Giannis has stepped up his game even more recently — playing his way back into the forefront of the MVP discussion. 	|
8	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	+2	|	36-22	|	Winners of 6 of their last 7 games with a net rating of +15.0, the Jazz are well and truly back in the swing of things. Donovan Mitchell has averaged 27/6/6 on 50/43/86 shooting to spearhead this resurgence to form. The Jazz are 3-11 this season when missing Donovan or Rudy but with the duo back and healthy a surge up the standings remains a possibility with the final quarter of the season remaining	|
9	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	--	|	35-24	|	Kristaps Porzingis was traded at the last minute of the NBA Trade Deadline, and it has huge implications for the Mavs. Spencer Dinwiddie could be a much-needed slasher alongside Luka Doncic that can hopefully defend at even an average level while also getting to the line at a high rate. The other piece of the trade, Davis Bertans, is expected to replicate Porzingis' best shooting days, but this trade could leave a massive hole at center on both ends. We won't know the success/failures of this trade for some time, but the risk is high, and the Mavs taking on 2 bad contracts hasn't been celebrated in Dallas.	|
10	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	-3	|	35-23	|	The Cavaliers went 2-2 since the last rankings, and a lot of hot eastern teams means that we’re only 2.5 games ahead of the play-in, yet only 2.5 games from the conference lead. With Okoro/Mobley winning the Rising Stars game Friday, Team Cavs winning the skills competition Saturday, and Garland/Allen winning the all-star game Sunday, the Cavs are feeling like the winners of all-star weekend. The break served as a much needed rest for what looked like tired legs in the last few games, and the imminent return of Lauri Markkanen should reinvigorate this squad for a final push in which we do not have much of a margin for error. Fun fact: The Cavs have had 10 different players lead the team in scoring in games that they’ve won this season.	|
11	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	--	|	34-26	|	The Celtics are rolling. The acquisitions of Derrick White and Daniel Theis, as well as sending off 7 players at the trade deadline, has totally changed the team. Everyone is clicking, and the Celtics are 11-2 over their past 13 games. They're now only 4.5 games back on the 1 seed, and on paper, have one of the easier remaining schedules in the league. It could be a fun and interesting remaining season for the Celtics. 	|
12	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	--	|	33-25	|	With the end of the All-Star festivities in Cleveland and the devastating breakup of the Luka-Jokic love affair (for now), it's time to shift the focus to the back stretch of the season. With 24 games remaining, Denver has the 4th easiest remaining SOS in the West (8th in the league), and despite being an ASG starter, Jokic was still able to get some much needed rest for this final push into the playoffs, both of which spell good news for the Nuggets. Along with the expected/hopeful returns of MPJ and Jamal Murray in March or April, the team has the potential to become a huge threat to whoever they match up with in the playoffs, and we can only pray that these 24 games don't involve Jokic exhausting himself carrying an underperforming roster.	|
13	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	--	|	32-25	|	Raptors are 4-2 since the last power rankings, finishing strong before a much needed all star break. With our minutes distribution being so high amongst our starters the rest should hopefully help some of our guys get some fresh legs, in particular OG Anunoby and Fred Van Vleet have looked quite fatigued in this final stretch. Our trade deadline pickup of Thad Young has looked promising so far, and hopefully we are able to delegate more minutes to the bench in the post all star stretch as a result. Shout out to Dalano Banton for his improved bench play as well, looking to see more of him after the break.	|
14	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	--	|	31-28	|	All Star break was definitely needed as the Wolves defense has taken a dip in part to tired legs. On the bright side the Wolves have been able to be successful on the offensive end. Also KAT took the 3-point challenge crown putting another claim as the best shooting big of all time.	|
15	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	--	|	31-28	|	The Nets are close to seeing the return of Kevin Durant and the debut of Ben Simmons to the lineup. This will drastically change how the team plays and Nets fans are ready for the 2nd half surge that we need. While some believe it's advantageous for the Nets to get a lower seed so Kyrie can play 4 games instead of 3, it will likely require a harder path to the Finals as a result. With cities around the globe dropping vaccine mandates, it is likely Kyrie will return to full-time status soon enough. Joe Harris is going to try and play on his ankle in the near future, but the looming threat of another surgery is still there as the training staff will have to see encouraging steps in his recovery in order to OK him playing the rest of the year.	|
16	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+1	|	30-31	|	If the current healthy squad was the full healthy squad, I would remenice about 2018. This Clips squad has shown to be talented, resilient, and still a threat. With questions of Kawhu and PG's return looming, these playoffs have a chance to be more interesting than previously thought.	|
17	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	-1	|	28-30	|	More of the same as the season goes on for the Hawks. Sometimes they look great and sometimes they look awful. Sometimes they play like a team that should have homecourt advantage in the first round and sometimes they play like a lottery team. It's maddeningly inconsistent but at the very least we took some momentum into the break with back-to-back wins over the Cavs and Magic. Another reason to have hope is that the Hawks have the fifth easiest remaining schedule in the league as they try to hopefully finish the season in the 7-8 range rather than the 9-10. 	|
18	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	+1	|	27-31	|	It’s very telling on how this season is turning out to be, when the biggest narrative during the All-Star break is Lebron’s impending free agency in 2023;despite him being under contract even next year, his comments praising other GMs like Presti, Altman and an interview stating he’d be willing to play with any team that drafts Bronny are all being seen as him indirectly expressing disappointment with the organization being dormant at the trade deadline. On the court, things only got worse as AD rolled his ankle very badly vs. the Jazz on the last game before the break and is expected to miss at least 4 weeks. After yet another facepalming loss to the tanking Blazers, they came out with a resounding energy on the road vs. the Warriors but felt short, it carried over to the win vs. the Jazz but how much of it will remain post All-Star break for a significant stretch without AD will define this season for the Lakers. They are 6 games behind the 6th seed and 1.5 games behind the 8th seeded Clippers; for a team that doesn’t even have a win streak of more than 4, they would have to put their best stretch of basketball to at least end up in the 7/8th seeded play-in game.	|
19	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	-1	|	29-31	|	It wouldn’t be a Charlotte Hornets season without a massive backslide destroying all glimmers of hope. It’s not as bad as it sounds, though, because the future still looks so bright. That said, this season appears destined for another play-in game debacle if we can’t get back into early-season form. Gordon Hayward has an indefinite injury timeline, surprising no one. Is this just going to happen every year for eternity? At least we got to see LaMelo show out in an All-Star Game; the first of many. I am so excited for the future, it barely bothers me that this season is such a mess.	|
20	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	+2	|	27-31	|	The Dallas Mavericks really gave us a second-round pick while taking on Davis Bertans' contract. Despite the reality that this season is effectively a tank given shutdown of Bradley Beal, there's a lot to be happy about with the Wizards. The young talent continues to impress - with Rui Hachimura quietly shooting some incredible numbers. Corey Kispert continues to age well as a rookie and Deni Avidja is starting to see more and more possesions as a point guard -- potentially signaling a future as ""We have a Ben Simmons at home"" for the Washington Wizards. The top of the draft class continues to be exciting; we still haven't given Bradley Beal a mega contract. Life is good.	|
21	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+2	|	23-36	|	The stealth tank rolls on! At the All-Star break, the Spurs sit with a +0.4 Net Rating despite being *13 games* below .500! Their NRtg has them right at the middle of the league rankings and comparable to teams like the Hawks, Nets, Hornets, Clippers, Lakers, Wizards and more. If they can keep this up, they'll be in elite company: only three teams (1977 Suns, 2017 and 2018 Hornets) have managed even a 0.0 Net Rating over a full season despite being 10+ games below .500. I have to give the Spurs a solid B+ to A- for how they're executing this season: good, competitive performances despite losing, traded off a few of our older players for FRPs, Dejounte's taken a sizeable leap, Jakob is likely the biggest value contract for a good starter in the league, Keldon has taken huge strides in his shooting, Vassell is starting and Primo is getting genuine playing time. I will absolutely miss Derrick White, but I'm happy that he's thriving in Boston (he's an excellent fit for their roster) and happier still that we're getting a first-round pick from the deal. See y'all in the top-4 of the lottery this year! The Spurs finish the backend of the Rodeo Road trip with @WAS, @MIA and @MEM and will also play SAC and @CHA in the next two weeks.	|
22	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	+2	|	25-34	|	The Blazers have been strangely effective recently, going 4-0 since the start of the Joe Ingles era. Simons continues his strong MIP campaign, but newcomers Josh Hart and Justise Winslow have also had a big part in the success of the new-look Blazers. Time will tell if this is sustainable - the first three wins were against pretty mediocre competition. But they passed their first real test by beating the Grizzles before the All-Star break. Stay tuned.	|
24	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-3	|	23-36	|		|
24	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	-4	|	25-34	|	[yeah](https://imgur.com/EerpZr8)	|
25	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	--	|	22-38	|		|
26	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	--	|	20-40	|	The tank. Is. ON. After years of hovering between middling playoff team and barely non-zero playoff odds, the Pacers have finally committed to a total rebuild. The trade deadline saw Indiana send off their two-time All-Star Domantas Sabonis (along with role players Holiday and Lamb) to Sacramento in exchange for Tyrese Haliburton. To say Pacers fans are ecstatic to finally have a young, promising point guard to build around is an understatement. And now Indiana will focus on their draft position armed with a bevy of assets.	|
27	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	--	|	18-40	|	The win/loss record continues to predictably plummet for the Thunder, as the last two weeks featured a difficult schedule including Golden State, at Philadelphia, and at Chicago. However, rookie point guard Josh Giddey has trended in a much more optimistic direction, putting up a 28-point triple double in OKC's Valentine's Day victory over New York, even starting to sneak into the top 3 of some rookie of the year lists.	|
28	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	--	|	15-43	|	Did we trade Gordon? No. Did we trade Wood? No. Did our bet on Theis payoff? Also no. But...we have Schroder now, even though we have no shortage of young guards vying for playing time. A lot of Rockets fans are puzzled by the moves Stone made at this deadline, but maybe, just maybe, there is a chance that the vet presence helps the young players develop? That's our best hope.	|
29	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	--	|	13-47	|	Deadline ended up being much calmer than expected. Only one trade that ended with MCW, E""Twaun Moore and PJ Dozier being waived, and Bol Bol being stashed away for WeltHam's longboi scheme. Wagner, Suggs and Cole showed out during the Rising Stars portion of All-Star Weekend, but Cole's dunk contest performance was lackluster to say the least. Now it's time to suck for the rest of the season and secure top odds at the number one pick.	|
30	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	--	|	13-45	|	Bey, Stew and Cade looked pretty good in the Rising Stars tournament. Congrats to Cade on winning that ugly ass Clorox trophy. The future is bright, but our present looks as bad as the dunk contest. I'm not the tank captain, errr coach, but hopefully Casey starts experimenting with our lineups to play more of our young guys together and less CoJo and friends.	|",1,70,11,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

3667,70,Reggie Miller Legacy,"I need help from NBA fans older than me.

I don’t remember what prompted me to do this but I looked up Reggie Miller’s Basketball Reference page and saw that he only made the All-Star game 5 times. Only 4 times during what I understood were his “prime” years. Now 5 All-Star appearances is nothing less than impressive but, as someone born in 1997 and don’t really have a first-hand experience watching Reggie, I always thought he would’ve been one of those staples of the 90s. Like a dude who would be an All-Star based on reputation even if he had an underwhelming season and this doesn’t seem to be the case.

So, I’m curious, who is someone who has played from 2005ish-present who you think has/had a comparable reputation to Reggie Miller? This isn’t a player comparison. They don’t have to have a similar skill set or talent level. Just who is a guy with a reputation similar to RM’s that may help me understand where he stood as a 90s NBA icon.

Thanks for the help :)

3671,74,Giannis has become an inspiration for me in my life,"I’m a Warriors fan but I just wanted to say that Giannis is my personal inspiration in the NBA. Obviously he’s one of the greatest ever but the thing I love about him is that he’s not afraid to get clowned for his flaws and doing what it takes to get better at them. 

It was really inspirational for me watching him last year in the playoffs. This man went on national TV, on the biggest stage, and was getting clowned for his 30 second free throw routine, his two practice free-throw motions before getting the ball, taking forever at the line etc. Players were getting frustrated, the fans were mocking him with the countdowns, refs were even getting impatient, and despite this longass routine Giannis was still clanking his free throws! But he didn’t care. He just kept doing his thing. He didn’t mind that he looked silly. He didn’t mind that people were laughing at him. He just wanted to get better. 

Same with his 3-point shot. His form was awkward (getting better now) and historically it’s been a bad shot, especially when he can just drive to the rim and do Giannis things. But he didn’t wait for it to become a good shot in practice. He hasn’t been hiding it in practice until it gets good. He’s always been willing to shoot it in the games in front of everyone. You’d think that Giannis could just rest easy in what he’s good at, being a Shaq-like force of nature. He doesn’t need to shoot 3s and expose himself to criticism when he could just play it safe and play in the paint.

In recent years I’ve taken up dancing late in my 20s. I love it and have been working hard at it but I know I look like a fool. I’ve always hated dancing in front of other people. But I’m continuing to practice and work at it. It gives me comfort to think of Giannis and how he didn’t care what other people thought when he was at the free throw line, he didn’t care that he was getting mocked on a national stage. 

So the player I want to be like in the league is Giannis. Not cuz of the MVPs or the crazy athleticism but just because he’s so willing to be himself, flaws and all. He’s never been ashamed of who he is and that’s what’s made him so great.",1,51,10,0.5267,0.0,0.726,0.274

3679,82,All-Star Weekend Concept: 1-on-1 Tournament and the Winner's Team Receives the 31st Pick in the Draft,"This has been a concept I've been workshopping, so open to any and all feedback!

**Problem Statement**: The NBA's All-Star Weekend has fallen flat in recent years. The problem is not exclusive to the NBA. MLB, NFL, and NHL have dealt with varying degrees of staleness in their All-Star games/weekends.

The Elam Ending and the charitable component have spiced up the All-Star game; however, the other events of All-Star Weekend could use some tweaks.

**Proposed Solution**: Introduce a new 1-on-1 tournament where the winner's team receives the 31st pick in the NBA Draft.

**Overview**: Each team will have a 1-on-1 representative and be seeded in accordance with the team's position in the standings. Discretion is left to the teams who will represent them. The tournament will be single elimination and there will be byes for the top-2 teams. Top-2 is defined as the two teams in the league with the best overall record. 1-on-1s will be played to 7 (1s and 2s; 1st to 7).

The team of the winning player will receive a 2nd-round-pick (31st overall) and the player will receive a bonus (amount TBD). Since the team of the winning player will receive the 31st pick, there will now be 61 picks in the draft. Moreover, the team that would typically pick 31st will now pick 32nd.",1,101,16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
3680,83,Is there any shot for Steph to win MVP?,"Right now, Embid, Jokic, Giannis, CP3 and probably Derozan are all ahead of Steph in the MVP race.

Does he have any shot to win MVP? 


Personally, maybe he could sneak into top 3 if the warriors win 60+ games and he gets his averages up to 27/5.5/7 on 45/40/92, but I’m not sure if he has any chance to win it after that long slump he was in.

Here is what the NBA could include as future awards referencing the legends of the game:

* The *Kareem-Abdul Jabbar NBA Most Valuable Player*, named after the player with the most League MVPs in history with six.
* The *Michael Jordan NBA Scoring Leader*, named after the player with the most League Scoring Titles, with 10.
* The *Wilt Chamberlain NBA Rebounding Leader*, named after the player with the most League Rebounding Titles, with 11.
* The *John Stockton NBA Assists Leader*, named after the player with the most League Assists Titles, with 9.
* The *Hakeem Olajuwon NBA Blocks Leader*, named after the player with the second most League Block Titles, but holds the record for the most career blocks with 3,830 (since 1973-1974).

and once they retire,

* The *Chris Paul NBA Steals Leader*, named after the player with the most League Steals Titles, with six (potentially more as he is only 0.1 SPG behind first this season).
* The *Stephen Curry NBA Three-Point Shot Leader*, named after the player who has lead the league with the most three-point shots, with six times, potentially seven after this season. This award could be included in the future with the prevalence of three-point shots added to the game.
* The *LeBron James NBA Consistency Award*, given to a player once they manage to get selected to a decade's worth of All-Star/All-NBA teams. More so like an achievement, but would be a nice addition to recognize player's longevity and commitment to the game.

Obviously you wouldn't need to add names to every award, but it was just enjoyable creating this list. Maybe you could also name the DPOY, 6MOY, ROY, COTY (after Pop or Phil) etc.",1,44,8,0.4588,0.0,0.7,0.3

Draymond was great on the sideline and has a clear future on the set. The ""Manningcast"" concept of more natural conversation and Dray doing sideline interviews I think worked pretty well. 

My two criticisms were: 1) It was at times very hard to understand what was being said. They at least fixed Dray's abysmal mic from when he was first brought in but I think everyone needed something that was more directional as the arena was picking up too much other background noise. 2) The box in the box containing the actual game footage was too small. Compared to the Manningcast, which probably displays the game at 90% of the screen size, this was probably about 60% because they decided they needed to show everyone in one wide frame. If they had four different cameras on each of the Inside guy's faces they could have stacked them along the left edge. 

All in all, it was a fun change and would 100% watch again.",1,68,14,0.6249,0.0,0.76,0.24

A suggestion I’ve seen pretty often is making free throws subtract points in the 4th quarter, but that makes optimal strategy to purposely foul if you’re losing towards the end of the game. Will players intentionally foul in an all star game? Maybe not, but theorizing better game design never hurts.

- An easy solution I can think of is having the first n (maybe 5) fouls against a team in the 4th subtract from the opponent’s score, then add to your own score after. I can’t think of an in-game drawback, but it might be confusing for the audience.

- A more straightforward solution might be to reduce the max fouls a player can collect in the 4th before fouling out (e.g. 2 fouls max). But that might lead to its own set of issues (e.g. incentivizes foul-baiting)

- my favourite solution is to replace free throws with a 1v1 (at least in the 4th), sort of like a penalty shootout. Effectively turns fts into something cool to watch, and intentional fouling becomes more situationally useful.",1,57,9,0.4767,0.0,0.721,0.279

3719,22,[Windhorst] Lakers might have to trade LeBron James this summer,"&gt;The Los Angeles Lakers might have to trade for LeBron James this summer. James has rather clearly been offended by Lakers’ management twice over the past two weeks. First when it elected not to make a deal before the Feb. 10 trade deadline after he had both publicly and privately prodded for something. More accurately, he expected it. And second when Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka stepped over the line when he announced James was on board with the status quo; a source told ESPN there was no prior sign-off from James.

&gt;James has never cared about draft picks, present or future. He's had occasional interest in developing young teammates, adopting a few over the years. But he's never had a problem saying goodbye if shipping them out moves him closer to a gold trophy faster. Any young guy on his roster who thinks differently hasn't done his research.

&gt;After the Lakers won the title in 2020, James extended his contract two seasons through 2023. Because of the rules around that extension, James wasn't able to get a player option in the deal. It is the first time he hasn't had an option to end a contract early since he was on his rookie deal almost two decades ago.

&gt;It wasn't even an issue when the deal was announced, but that is a fortunate circumstance now. The Lakers will get this summer without having to worry about James hitting free agency and watching them work before deciding on re-signing.

&gt;The Lakers have a flawed roster -- yes, James played a large role in putting it together but that doesn't mean he isn't ready to divorce it -- but they have options. If Russell Westbrook picks up his own player option, he will be on a $47 million expiring contract.

Larry Bird’s three point contest win in 1988 with the infamous finger in the air may be the closest thing to that moment.

It’s less than 24 hours and I can stop watching that Tre-Giannis look away shot over and over and over again.

That performance gave NBA fans who remember that Vince Carter 2001 dunk contest like chills.",1,70,14,0.6369,0.0,0.756,0.244

I was legit looking forward to this ceremony since they announced the 75th Team. I just saw some of last night's 75th Anniversary Team ceremony and was disappointed.

They made special team jackets for the players to celebrate this, but the players didn't wear them. Why? I don't know. The players wearing their team jackets were one of the coolest parts of the last ceremony. It was kind of a cool visual of the history of the NBA and the players wearing regular suit jackets weren't the same. The players also didn't really have graphics that showed their team logos or history which was also part of the fun of the last one.

Only some of the players came out for the ceremony while almost everyone who was able to came out for the 50th. I know some of the players are gone now, but a decent bit of people who could have been there weren't, which hurt the ceremony. I know there's maybe some virus concerns, but maybe there's a better way it could have been done.

I was also hoping they'd maybe put up a screen or a graphic or something to include some of the players who aren't alive anymore so the whole team could pose together. I hope people don't make a joke out of it, but I thought it would have been cool if they did a football roster style photo/visual where maybe the players who passed away could be included with the team.

The segment whole felt rushed and I don't really understand why Usher or Earth Wind and Fire had to be involved. I don't think some of the non-basketball stuff had to be included either.",1,58,9,-0.4767,0.307,0.693,0.0

So
Well, the softer fix is we pair each NBA entrant with a professional dunker coach who will meet with them and try and make sure they have something creative to do
But
Maybe a more entertaining option could be to have a horse game tournament (or probably 'pig' bc 5 dunks would take forever). The order of the professional dunkers could be decided at a separate tournament, the winner of that is the ""final boss""
Each NBA dunker has to defeat a gauntlet of professional dunkers. Or maybe it's a big game of pig with professionals mixed in

I personally think it would be fine if none of the NBA guys won sometimes but considering the professional dunkers spend all their time dunking and none of it breaking down film of the Utah Jazz inbound plays, the professionals would win most of the time so... I dunno what to do about that.

One thing this does, if an NBA player can't do a professional dunkers dunk, it's going to demonstrate exactly how difficult it was. And that's good entertainment.

1. Context is important. Lakers trade the farm for Russ this past off season at the behest of LeBron and AD.

2. Lakers are underwhelming at best in the first half of the season.

3. Here's where the cold war starts to begin. LeGM knows he can do better than this version of Russ, wants to trade for John Wall who has been resting (sitting on his ass) for a decade but LeGM figures why not try and trade for a 5x all star who has a career average of 9 assists per game with legs that are fresh af.

4. Lakers retaliate and tell LeGm to LeFuckOff - you created this shit storm of a team and you will fucking like it or you'll leave. Lakers, one of the league's best franchises, aren't going to get bullied around by one of the greatest players of all time - a showdown for the ages.

5. Most recent update on the western front happened in Cleveland this weekend, where LeBron made comments never ruling out a return to Cleveland, hyping up other GMs around the league, and saying his last season will be spent where Bronny will be playing.

3770,73,How I would revamp the NBA dunk contest.,"Ok let me start with: this isn’t perfect but I feel like it’s a step in the right direction.

First off, we all realize the biggest problem with this most recent contest was the “unlimited” attempts, but we also realize from past dunk contests that a timer isn’t really a better solution.

So hear me out.

The first round of the playoffs is 2 minutes for each player. They have to run back and forth (full court) and they can dunk as many times as they would like. The judges, meanwhile, have to judge each dunk. Then they take the 5 highest scoring dunks and add up all the judges scores for those dunks. (Don’t get hung up on the amount of time or attempts. It doesn’t have to be 5 dunks, or 2 minutes, but whatever makes the most sense).

Now they can run down and windmill 1 dunk in, off the backboard the next, followed by a reverse slam at the other end, maybe they miss their next one but then run back for a 360. Whatever they want. They can pre-choreograph it with a couple guys who hang on each end of the court. You can still have the ball at a full court run, or alley-oop at the opposite end. This makes for a more fast paced dunk contest that’s likely more exciting.",1,40,8,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

3772,75,Adele's Go Easy On Me was written about her boyfriend Rich Paul's client Ben Simmons,"When you look at the lyrics of Go Easy On Me, it suspiciously fits the Ben Simmons saga

&gt;There ain't no gold in this river That I've been washin' my hands in forever I know there is hope in these waters But I can't bring myself to swim When I am drowning in this silence Baby, let me in

The first verse talks about how Ben is realizing that Philly isn't the city for him. There is no opportunity for a championship hence ""no gold"" in this river aka Doc Rivers as a coach. He knows there's a promising core here with Embiid (hope in these waters) but he couldn't bring himself to continue in Philly

On to verse 2

&gt;There ain't no room for things to change When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways You can't deny how hard I have tried I changed who I was to put you both first But now I give up

This is talking about Ben's ability to shoot the ball. No room for change in his skillset. He is deeply stuck in his ways. We can't deny how hard Philly has tried to change who Ben is but they've given up

Now the chorus

&gt;Go easy on me, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose What I chose to do So go easy on me

This is Adele singing to the 76ers fan base to go easy on Ben. He is still relatively young and he really hasn't gotten a chance to feel out his options. He had no choice but to hold out to get out of his situation. So go easy on him.

&gt;I had good intentions And the highest hopes But I know right now That probably doesn't even show

He really thinks he gave it his all for Philly, and had high aspirations as one of the faces of the Process. But he knew at the time it probably didn't show when he was sitting out.

Overall given Adele's connections to Ben Simmons agent Rich Paul it doesn't seem impossible that this song was actually written subliminally about Ben.",1,84,15,0.7579,0.0,0.667,0.333

** MY KEY TAKEAWAYS**

1. We all know Player's Prime ranges from 26-32 yrs old. So these young players will most likely improve as years to come. Future of Nba is Secured!!!

2. With Advanced Technology, Better Training, Healtier Nutrition Program, etc. More and More young players are being ready to contribute away already in nba. 

3. Most of them are either rookies or players in rookie contracts. Yet, they are able to make the top 50 nba players today.

4. As much as I am in between old heads and new heads, I think evolution of players will just continue to improve as time goes by. 

5. Solid Rookies like Cade, Mobley, Giddey, Barnes, Jalen, Wagner,  etc  would likely to join them in a few years.",1,80,16,0.2714,0.0,0.878,0.122

- Skills Challenge then goes on as the 2nd event...I like the team concept you can do Team Jazz vs Team Rooks vs Team whoever I don't know 

- Then the last event, the main event should be the 3 Point Shootout going on last to close All Star Saturday Night in Utah

Bronny is currently a top 50 high school prospect and a Junior. So we are still about 3 draft years away from Bronny being Eligible, and given that he is only ranking in the mid 30s as a prospect, it can be argued he is only a borderline NBA talent.

The video concluded with a short, off-hand mention of Curry’s latest All-Star nod. As Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser acknowledged, “For Steph, I hate to say it, but I think it’s old hat.”

**“We all got a great kick out of the formality that is Steph Curry being named a starter in the All-Star Game,**” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “**Maybe that’s when you know you’ve made it — when nobody even bothers to congratulate you on that kind of achievement.”** 

Still, Curry stressed that tweak is “nothing really to hype up there.” Instead, he offered a simple solution on what it will take to shoot more consistently after the All-Star break.

**“Just shoot,”** Curry said. “**There’s no key. It’s always a matter of perspective with never losing confidence and do what you know how to do.”**

Moments later, former NBA sharpshooter and current NBA TV analyst Dennis Scott politely interrupted Curry’s interview so he could ask a question.

“Shooters shoot,” Scott said. “So, why do people panic so quickly when you have a couple of bad games and you show you’re human?”

“**Because I’m not allowed to**,” Curry said, laughing.

“You’re not allowed to be human, right?” Scott said. “So, it drives me crazy as a shooter. ‘What’s wrong with Steph? He’s human!’ We’ve all had a week.”

Curry nodded affirmatively as the two shared a bond that only shooters could truly understand.

“T**here is a moment**,” Curry said. “**Maybe the 15 \[shots\] before, you can start to see a little bit of a pattern. The rest of it is lazy because you don’t really watch the game.”**

 Curry ranks 82nd out of 592 NBA players in defensive rating (101.7), only five spots behind Green (101.5). Among NBA guards, Curry ranks 17th in defensive rebounds per game (4.8). That has happened because Curry has bulked up his 6-foot-2, 185-pound frame while improving his fundamentals and decision-making in recent seasons.

**“I got stronger so you can handle physicality a little bit better,**” Curry said. “I**f guys want to roll you into the post or defending a drive, you take that first hit and don’t get knocked off balance. Then you don’t foul unnecessarily because youlre not reacting. You always stay in control. I’ve always tried to see the floor well and be one step ahead and see the passing lanes. But when you can add the on-ball presence, that helps.”**

**“People are bored with Spo’s greatness, and it sucks because I think right now you’re talking about Coach of the Year**,” said retired Heat legend Dwyane Wade, who spent most of his NBA career with Spoelstra as his head coach. 

**“We’ve said it multiple times, but if there’s any year that he has shown that he can coach his face off, it’s this year.**” 

Spoelstra, 51, has been a Coach of the Year candidate multiple time before but has never earned the honor. Spoelstra is again a contender for the award this season. Not only does the Heat enter the break with one of the NBA’s best records, but it’s also one of only two teams with both a top-eight offensive rating and defensive rating this season along with the Phoenix Suns. The Heat has accomplished that despite facing a long list of injuries and COVID-19 issues along the way. The leading trio of Bam Adebayo, Butler and Kyle Lowry have played together in only 21 of Miami’s 59 games this season. “**I think he should definitely get Coach of the Year,” Adebayo said.** “**I feel like he has been in one of those places this year where guys are out unexpectedly, guys come in unexpectedly, guys come out randomly. It has been like that this whole year. For him to still manage and still have the right mind-set to try to win instead of some people, I guess, they lose their players and they’re like the season is over. His mind-set isn’t like that.**” With Adebayo missing seven weeks because of a thumb injury from December to mid-January, the Heat managed to post a 14-8 record in his absence. In games played without Adebayo and Butler this season, Miami is somehow 11-4. Find more sports news,

3821,24,The NBA put out a great product tonight," 

Imagine someone not familiar with the NBA watching tonight’s event. They might never miss a game again.

First off, Steph going absolutely sky-fuckeringly insane from 3 tonight  (16/21 at one point) might be in the top 5 most memorable moments in NBA All-star history. Giannis and JA battling Embiid? Derozan burying clutch shots? Lebron hitting the game-winning shot in CLEVELAND? I wanna know who signed off on this and thought this is what the people wanted to see. The celebration of league history and the game’s best of the best was inspiringly heartfelt and memorable. The All-star game itself was unbelievable. A truly orgasmic presentation of players showing off their skills and coalescing their talents to leave a lasting impression on fans around the world. And of course you had the newly revamped and revitalized format of the game which might have single-handedly revived the event for the foreseeable future.

TNT’s production as a whole was also fantastic. I know it's said a lot, but Shaq and Chuck honestly deserve to be treated as national treasures for how effortlessly they can amplify the experience of NBA events through their commentary and banter. The hyped-as-shit Cleveland crowd definitely helped raise the vibe too of course.

3830,33,Run overtime according to the Elam Ending/Target Scoring next season," The Elam ending / target scoring idea is really cool. If switching all games to that seems like too much, fine. How about just overtime? For one season, all overtimes are played as ""First to 10."" We can see how it goes, and if people like it, it can be continued. If it doesn't work out well for whatever reason, then it's dropped for the next season.

As is, overtime is cool, but the beginning of the overtime is often a lull where the intensity decreases compared to the end of the fourth. Elam would fix that, and scoring 10 points would on average take a bit under five minutes of game time.

I think it's important to choose a number that doesn't privilege 3s over 2s. Nine, for example, would be a bad choice. The fact that it's a multiple of three would psychologically encourage guys to chuck, and a team that made only 3s would only need three makes to hit the target, whereas a team that made only 2s would need 5 makes to hit a target of nine.

League average 2p% is right around 53%. This suggests that a hypothetical team that only shot 2-pointers would need, on average, 9.4 attempts to hit a target of nine (scoring 10 points.) League average three-point percentage is about 35%, so a hypothetical 3-pointers only time would need, on average, 8.6 attempts to hit the target score of nine. This would really encourage shooting threes.

However, with 10, the team that makes only 3s needs four makes, and the team that makes only 2s would need five makes. The only-threes team would need an average of 11.4 attempts, compared to still just 9.4 attempts for the 2-point shooting team. This encourages shooting twos.

If you wanted it to be a bit shorter, seven and eight would be good targets as well. For targets of 7 and 8, the three pointers only team would need 8.6 attempts, and the 2-pointers only team would need 7.5

The Elam ending is not a gimmick. It's how everyone has played at the park since they were a little kid. The foul game is the gimmick that sucks the life out of basketball, and going to Elam Overtimes would reduce that foul game just a bit.",1,68,10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Remember, the NBA 75 is supposedly a historical list, not one based on predictions of careers (or Luka should be on it too based on his career so far). Of course Damian is 'loyal' to Rip City and Dwight has silently become a role player, but at NBA's 75th anniversary, the comparison is not even close. Thoughts?
